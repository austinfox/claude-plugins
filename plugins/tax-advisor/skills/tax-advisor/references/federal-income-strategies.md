# Federal Income Tax Strategies Reference — Tax Year 2025

> **Effective Law:** Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) as made permanent by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), signed into law 2025. SECURE 2.0 Act provisions also in effect. This reference reflects post-OBBBA law for the 2025 tax year.

---

## Tax Bracket Structure (2025, Post-OBBBA — TCJA Made Permanent)

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act made the TCJA individual tax rates **permanent**. The sunset originally scheduled for December 31, 2025 no longer applies. All seven brackets remain in effect and are indexed for inflation.

### Single Filers

| Rate | Taxable Income Range |
|------|---------------------|
| 10%  | $0 - $11,925 |
| 12%  | $11,926 - $48,475 |
| 22%  | $48,476 - $103,350 |
| 24%  | $103,351 - $197,300 |
| 32%  | $197,301 - $250,525 |
| 35%  | $250,526 - $626,350 |
| 37%  | Over $626,350 |

### Married Filing Jointly (MFJ)

| Rate | Taxable Income Range |
|------|---------------------|
| 10%  | $0 - $23,850 |
| 12%  | $23,851 - $96,950 |
| 22%  | $96,951 - $206,700 |
| 24%  | $206,701 - $394,600 |
| 32%  | $394,601 - $501,050 |
| 35%  | $501,051 - $751,600 |
| 37%  | Over $751,600 |

### Head of Household (HoH)

| Rate | Taxable Income Range |
|------|---------------------|
| 10%  | $0 - $17,000 |
| 12%  | $17,001 - $64,850 |
| 22%  | $64,851 - $103,350 |
| 24%  | $103,351 - $197,300 |
| 32%  | $197,301 - $250,500 |
| 35%  | $250,501 - $626,350 |
| 37%  | Over $626,350 |

### Married Filing Separately (MFS)

| Rate | Taxable Income Range |
|------|---------------------|
| 10%  | $0 - $11,925 |
| 12%  | $11,926 - $48,475 |
| 22%  | $48,476 - $103,350 |
| 24%  | $103,351 - $197,300 |
| 32%  | $197,301 - $250,525 |
| 35%  | $250,526 - $375,800 |
| 37%  | Over $375,800 |

**Marginal vs. effective rate:** Always distinguish between these. A taxpayer "in the 32% bracket" pays 32% only on income above that bracket's threshold. Effective rates are typically much lower. The permanence of TCJA rates eliminates the urgency of accelerating income into lower-bracket years before a hypothetical 2026 reversion. Long-term planning can now assume these rates persist indefinitely, absent future legislation.

## Standard Deduction (2025, Post-OBBBA)

| Filing Status | Standard Deduction |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Single | $15,750 |
| Married Filing Jointly | $31,500 |
| Head of Household | $23,625 |
| Married Filing Separately | $15,750 |

### Additional Deduction for Age 65+ or Blind

- **Married (each qualifying spouse):** $1,600 per qualifying condition
- **Single or Head of Household:** $2,000 per qualifying condition
- These stack: a single filer who is both 65+ and blind receives $4,000 additional

### NEW: Senior Bonus Deduction (OBBBA, 2025-2028)

The OBBBA introduced a temporary additional standard deduction for seniors:

- **Amount:** $6,000 additional deduction for taxpayers age 65 or older
- **Income limits:** MAGI below $75,000 (single) / $150,000 (MFJ)
- **Phase-out:** The $6,000 phases out ratably for MAGI between the threshold and $15,000 above it ($75K-$90K single, $150K-$165K MFJ)
- **Effective period:** Tax years 2025 through 2028 only
- **Combined effect:** A single filer age 65+ with MAGI under $75K receives $15,750 + $2,000 + $6,000 = **$23,750** total standard deduction
- **Itemizers:** This bonus is only available with the standard deduction, not for itemizers
- **Planning:** For clients with MAGI near the threshold, explore strategies to reduce MAGI below $75,000/$150,000 (maximize pre-tax retirement contributions, HSA contributions, above-the-line deductions)

---

## Retirement Account Contribution Limits and Strategies

### 401(k) / 403(b) / 457(b) Plans

| Category | 2025 Limit |
|----------|-----------|
| Elective deferral (under 50) | $23,500 |
| Catch-up (age 50+, excluding 60-63) | $7,500 additional ($31,000 total) |
| Super catch-up (ages 60-63, SECURE 2.0) | $11,250 additional ($34,750 total) |
| Total annual addition limit (Section 415(c)) | $70,000 |

**Super catch-up detail (SECURE 2.0 Section 109):** Participants who are ages 60, 61, 62, or 63 at the end of the tax year receive a higher catch-up contribution limit of $11,250. This replaces (does not add to) the standard $7,500 catch-up. At age 64, the participant reverts to the standard $7,500 catch-up.

**Traditional vs. Roth 401(k) decision:** Traditional provides a deduction now with taxed withdrawals in retirement. Roth provides no deduction now but tax-free withdrawals. Choose Roth when current marginal rate is lower than expected retirement rate, or in no-income-tax states (e.g., Washington) where there is no state tax benefit from traditional deferrals. Choose traditional when current marginal rate is high and expected retirement rate is lower.

### Traditional and Roth IRA

- **Contribution limit:** $7,000 (under 50) / $8,000 (age 50+, includes $1,000 catch-up)
- Combined limit across all traditional and Roth IRAs

**Roth IRA income phase-outs (MAGI):**

| Filing Status | Phase-out Range |
|---------------|----------------|
| Single / HoH | $150,000 - $165,000 |
| MFJ | $236,000 - $246,000 |
| MFS | $0 - $10,000 |

**Traditional IRA deductibility phase-outs (when contributor is covered by employer plan):**

| Filing Status | Phase-out Range |
|---------------|----------------|
| Single / HoH | $79,000 - $89,000 |
| MFJ (contributor covered) | $126,000 - $146,000 |
| MFJ (spouse covered, contributor not) | $236,000 - $246,000 |

If neither spouse is covered by an employer plan, the full traditional IRA contribution is deductible regardless of income.

### Backdoor Roth IRA Strategy

For high earners above Roth IRA direct contribution income limits:

1. Contribute $7,000 ($8,000 if 50+) to a **non-deductible traditional IRA**
2. Convert the entire traditional IRA balance to Roth IRA promptly
3. Pay tax only on any gains between contribution and conversion (minimize by converting quickly)

**Pro-rata rule warning:** If the taxpayer holds any pre-tax traditional IRA balances (including SEP-IRA and SIMPLE IRA), the conversion will be taxed proportionally across all traditional IRA balances, not just the non-deductible portion. This makes the backdoor Roth partially or fully taxable. **Solution:** Roll all pre-tax IRA balances into an employer 401(k) plan before executing the backdoor Roth, leaving only the non-deductible balance to convert.

**Compliance note:** The OBBBA did not close the backdoor Roth. The IRS has been aware of this strategy for over a decade. Report the non-deductible contribution on Form 8606.

### Mega Backdoor Roth

For taxpayers whose 401(k) plan permits after-tax (non-Roth) contributions and in-service distributions or in-plan Roth rollovers:

1. Max out pre-tax or Roth 401(k) deferrals ($23,500)
2. Contribute after-tax dollars up to the $70,000 Section 415(c) limit (minus employee deferrals and employer match/contributions)
3. Convert after-tax contributions to Roth via in-plan Roth rollover or rollover to Roth IRA

**Potential additional Roth space:** Up to approximately $46,500 per year beyond normal deferrals, depending on employer contributions.

**Requires plan support** — not all 401(k) plans allow after-tax contributions or in-service distributions/rollovers. Verify plan document terms before advising.

### Roth Conversion Strategy

Converting traditional IRA or 401(k) balances to Roth triggers ordinary income tax in the year of conversion but provides tax-free growth and withdrawals thereafter. Optimal scenarios include:

- **Low-income years:** Sabbatical, early retirement, career transition, gap between jobs
- **No-state-income-tax residents (e.g., Washington):** Federal tax is the only cost of conversion — no state tax drag
- **Filling lower brackets:** Convert enough each year to fill the 12% or 22% bracket without pushing into a higher bracket
- **Before RMDs begin:** RMDs start at age 73 under SECURE 2.0. Converting balances down before mandatory distributions prevents forced higher-bracket income in later years
- **Young taxpayers:** Decades of tax-free compounding ahead maximizes the value of Roth treatment
- **Now that TCJA is permanent:** There is no longer a "convert before rates increase in 2026" deadline, but converting during lower-income years remains a sound strategy

## HSA: Triple Tax Advantage

### 2025 Contribution Limits

| Coverage Type | Limit |
|---------------|-------|
| Self-only | $4,300 |
| Family | $8,550 |
| Catch-up (age 55+) | Additional $1,000 |

### HDHP Requirements (Must Be Enrolled to Contribute)

| Parameter | Self-Only | Family |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Minimum annual deductible | $1,650 | $3,300 |
| Maximum out-of-pocket | $8,300 | $16,600 |

### The Triple Tax Benefit

1. **Tax-deductible contributions** (or pre-tax via payroll, which also avoids FICA — the payroll deduction method saves an additional 7.65%)
2. **Tax-free investment growth** inside the HSA
3. **Tax-free withdrawals** for qualified medical expenses at any time, with no time limit on reimbursement

### HSA as a Stealth Retirement Account

The optimal long-term strategy for taxpayers who can afford to pay current medical expenses out of pocket:

- Contribute the maximum annually via payroll deduction (to avoid FICA)
- Invest HSA funds in diversified index funds rather than the default cash sweep or money market
- Pay current medical expenses from after-tax funds and **save all receipts indefinitely**
- Reimburse yourself tax-free years or decades later — there is no deadline for reimbursement
- After age 65, withdraw for any purpose (taxed as ordinary income like a traditional IRA, but no penalty) or reimburse yourself tax-free for accumulated medical receipts from any prior year

This makes the HSA function as a super-Roth with no income limits, no RMDs, and the flexibility to access funds for any purpose after 65.

### Last-Month Rule and Testing Period

If a taxpayer becomes HSA-eligible on or before December 1, they may contribute the full annual limit for that year (not a prorated amount). However, the taxpayer must remain HSA-eligible through December 31 of the following year (the 13-month "testing period"). Failure to maintain eligibility triggers inclusion of the excess contribution in income plus a 10% penalty on the excess amount.

## Standard vs. Itemized Deduction Analysis

### Key Itemized Deductions

**State and Local Taxes (SALT):**
- Cap increased to **$40,000** under OBBBA (up from $10,000 under TCJA), effective 2025-2029
- Phase-down: The $40,000 cap is reduced for taxpayers with MAGI above $500,000 (both single and MFJ)
- The cap amount rises by approximately 1% per year through 2029
- Includes state income tax OR state/local sales tax (taxpayer elects), plus real property tax, plus personal property tax
- For no-income-tax state residents (e.g., WA, TX, FL): SALT deduction is limited to property taxes plus the sales tax election

**Mortgage Interest:**
- Deductible on acquisition indebtedness up to $750,000 (for loans originated after December 15, 2017)
- Loans originated on or before December 15, 2017 retain the $1,000,000 limit
- Home equity loan interest is deductible only if proceeds are used to buy, build, or substantially improve the qualifying residence
- Points paid on purchase mortgage are generally deductible in the year of purchase

**Charitable Contributions:**
- Cash contributions to public charities: deductible up to 60% of AGI
- Appreciated long-term capital gain property: deductible at fair market value, up to 30% of AGI
- Excess contributions carry forward for up to 5 years
- Substantiation requirements: written acknowledgment from charity for gifts of $250+; Form 8283 for non-cash gifts over $500; qualified appraisal for non-cash gifts over $5,000

**Medical and Dental Expenses:**
- Deductible to the extent they exceed 7.5% of AGI (made permanent by OBBBA)
- Typically beneficial only in years with very large medical expenses or very low AGI
- Includes premiums not paid pre-tax, co-pays, prescriptions, dental, vision, long-term care premiums (with age-based limits)

### Bunching Strategy

For taxpayers whose itemized deductions hover near the standard deduction threshold in a typical year:

1. **Year 1 (bunching year):** Accelerate deductible expenses into one year — prepay property taxes (if permitted by jurisdiction), make two years of charitable contributions, prepay the January mortgage payment in December
2. **Year 2 (standard deduction year):** Take the standard deduction with minimal deductible expenses
3. Repeat the cycle in alternating years

This converts two years of deductions slightly below the standard deduction threshold into one year well above it (itemizing) and one year at the standard deduction.

### Donor-Advised Fund (DAF) for Charitable Bunching

A DAF amplifies the bunching strategy for charitable giving:

- Contribute multiple years of intended charitable gifts into a DAF in a single tax year
- Take the full itemized deduction in the contribution year
- Distribute grants from the DAF to chosen charities over subsequent years at any pace
- Particularly powerful when funded with **appreciated stock held over one year:** avoid capital gains tax entirely and deduct the full fair market value (up to 30% of AGI)
- Major DAF providers: Fidelity Charitable, Schwab Charitable, Vanguard Charitable (low minimums, typically $5,000-$25,000 to open)

## Tax Credits (with Phase-Outs)

### Child Tax Credit (CTC) — Post-OBBBA

- **Amount:** $2,200 per qualifying child under age 17 (increased from $2,000 by OBBBA)
- **Refundable portion:** Up to $1,700 as the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC)
- **Other dependents credit:** $500 for dependents who do not qualify for the CTC (age 17+, non-child dependents)
- **Phase-out:** Begins at AGI $200,000 (single/HoH) / $400,000 (MFJ), reduced by $50 per $1,000 of AGI over threshold
- **SSN requirement:** Qualifying child must have an SSN issued before the return due date (including extensions)

### Child and Dependent Care Credit

- Qualifying expenses: up to $3,000 for one qualifying individual, $6,000 for two or more
- Credit rate: 20% to 35% of qualifying expenses, depending on AGI (35% for AGI up to $15,000, declining to 20% at AGI of $43,000 and above)
- Maximum credit: $1,050 (one qualifying individual) / $2,100 (two or more) at the 35% rate
- Non-refundable
- Cannot claim for expenses also covered by a dependent care FSA; coordinate the two for optimal benefit

### Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)

Fully refundable credit for low- to moderate-income workers. Maximum credit amounts for 2025:

| Qualifying Children | Maximum Credit | Investment Income Limit |
|---------------------|---------------|------------------------|
| None | ~$632 | $11,600 |
| 1 | ~$4,213 | $11,600 |
| 2 | ~$6,960 | $11,600 |
| 3 or more | ~$7,830 | $11,600 |

Phase-out thresholds vary by filing status and number of qualifying children. The EITC is frequently underclaimed. MAGI and earned income must both fall within the applicable thresholds.

### Education Credits

**American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC):**
- $2,500 per eligible student (100% of first $2,000 + 25% of next $2,000 in qualified tuition and related expenses)
- First four years of post-secondary education only
- 40% refundable (up to $1,000 refundable per student)
- MAGI phase-out: $80,000 - $90,000 (single) / $160,000 - $180,000 (MFJ)

**Lifetime Learning Credit (LLC):**
- Up to $2,000 per return (20% of the first $10,000 in qualified expenses)
- No limit on years claimed; available for graduate, professional, and continuing education courses
- MAGI phase-out: $80,000 - $90,000 (single) / $160,000 - $180,000 (MFJ)
- Non-refundable

**Coordination rule:** Cannot claim both AOTC and LLC for the same student in the same year.

### Saver's Credit (Retirement Savings Contributions Credit)

- Up to $1,000 (single) / $2,000 (MFJ) for eligible contributions to retirement accounts
- Credit rate: 50%, 20%, or 10% depending on AGI
- 2025 AGI thresholds for 50% rate: approximately $24,250 (single) / $48,500 (MFJ); phases to 0% above approximately $38,250 (single) / $76,500 (MFJ)
- Non-refundable
- Frequently overlooked by lower-income taxpayers who do make retirement contributions

---

## New OBBBA Temporary Deductions (2025-2028)

These are above-the-line deductions available regardless of whether the taxpayer itemizes.

### No Tax on Tips

- **Above-the-line deduction** for cash tips and service tips up to **$25,000** per year
- Available to employees in occupations that customarily receive tips (restaurants, hospitality, personal services, etc.)
- Tips must be properly reported (on Form W-2 or equivalent documentation)
- The deduction applies to **federal income tax only** — FICA taxes (Social Security and Medicare) still apply to tip income
- Self-employment tip income does **not** qualify; this is limited to employees
- Effective for tax years 2025 through 2028

### Overtime Pay Deduction

- Above-the-line deduction for qualified overtime compensation
- **Limit:** Up to $12,500 (single) / $25,000 (MFJ) per year
- **Phase-out:** Begins at MAGI $150,000 (single) / $300,000 (MFJ), fully phased out $25,000 above those thresholds ($175K single / $325K MFJ)
- Applies to hours worked beyond 40 in a workweek as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)
- Salaried exempt employees generally do **not** qualify unless overtime is separately tracked and compensated
- FICA still applies to the overtime pay — only federal income tax is reduced
- Effective for tax years 2025 through 2028

### Auto Loan Interest Deduction

- Deduction for interest paid on auto loans for **U.S.-manufactured vehicles** (final assembly in the United States)
- **Limit:** Up to $10,000 in interest per year
- **Phase-out:** Begins at MAGI $100,000 (single) / $200,000 (MFJ)
- Applies to loans originated after the date of OBBBA enactment
- The vehicle must meet the U.S. final assembly requirement (similar to the now-expired clean vehicle credit's assembly test)
- Effective for tax years 2025 through 2028
- **Planning note:** This deduction is above-the-line, so it reduces AGI and benefits taxpayers regardless of itemizing status

---

## Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)

### 2025 Exemption Amounts

| Filing Status | Exemption | Phase-out Begins |
|---------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Single / HoH | $88,100 | $626,350 |
| MFJ | $137,000 | $1,252,700 |
| MFS | $68,500 | $626,350 |

- AMT tax rate: 26% on the first $239,100 of AMTI above the exemption ($119,550 for MFS), 28% on amounts above that
- The exemption phases out at $0.25 per $1 of AMTI above the phase-out threshold (fully eliminated at $978,750 single / $1,800,700 MFJ)

### Key AMT Triggers

- **Incentive Stock Options (ISOs):** The spread at exercise (fair market value minus exercise price) is an AMT preference item. A large ISO exercise can trigger tens or hundreds of thousands in AMT liability even though no cash was received.
- **SALT deduction:** With the SALT cap now at $40,000, this is a less common AMT trigger than in pre-TCJA years, but it remains relevant for those claiming large SALT deductions near the cap.
- **Private activity bond interest:** Tax-exempt interest from private activity municipal bonds is included in AMT income (AMTI).
- **Accelerated depreciation:** MACRS depreciation in excess of ADS (Alternative Depreciation System) straight-line depreciation is an AMT adjustment for certain property.

### AMT Planning Strategies

- **ISO exercise timing:** Spread exercises across multiple tax years to keep the AMT preference below the exemption amount. Alternatively, exercise and sell in the same calendar year (disqualifying disposition) to avoid the AMT preference entirely while still capturing the gain as ordinary income.
- **AMT credit carryforward:** AMT paid due to timing differences (primarily ISOs and depreciation) generates a minimum tax credit (reported on Form 8801) that can be used to offset regular tax liability in future years. Track this credit — it carries forward indefinitely.
- **Year-end modeling:** Run AMT projections in November or December. If a taxpayer is close to AMT territory, consider accelerating or deferring income, deductions, or ISO exercises to optimize across both the regular and AMT systems.
- **Exercise + hold analysis:** For ISO holders, model the AMT cost of exercising and holding (for long-term capital gains treatment on eventual sale) versus the regular tax cost of a disqualifying disposition. Factor in the AMT credit recovery in future years.

---

## Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) — 3.8%

### Overview

- **Rate:** 3.8% surtax on the lesser of (a) net investment income or (b) the amount by which MAGI exceeds the threshold
- **Thresholds (not indexed for inflation — these have not changed since 2013):**
  - Single / HoH: $200,000
  - MFJ / Qualifying surviving spouse: $250,000
  - MFS: $125,000

### Income Subject to NIIT

**Included:** Interest, dividends, capital gains (short and long term), rental income, royalty income, non-qualified annuity income, passive business income, and gain on sale of a principal residence exceeding the Section 121 exclusion ($250K single / $500K MFJ).

**Not included:** Wages, self-employment income from an active trade or business in which the taxpayer materially participates, Social Security benefits, tax-exempt municipal bond interest, distributions from qualified retirement plans (401(k), IRA, etc.), and Alaska Permanent Fund dividends.

### NIIT Mitigation Strategies

- **Real estate professional status (REPS):** If a taxpayer qualifies as a real estate professional and materially participates in rental activities, the rental income is treated as non-passive and is excluded from NIIT. Requires 750+ hours and more than half of personal services in real property trades or businesses.
- **Active business participation:** Ensure S-corporation and partnership income is from businesses in which the taxpayer materially participates (meets one of seven material participation tests under IRC Section 469). Passive business income is subject to NIIT; active business income is not.
- **Municipal bond allocation:** Shift fixed-income investments to tax-exempt municipal bonds, which are excluded from both regular income tax and NIIT.
- **Capital gains timing:** Harvest capital losses to offset gains. Defer gain recognition (installment sales, like-kind exchanges for real estate) into years where MAGI may fall below the NIIT threshold.
- **Maximize retirement contributions:** Pre-tax 401(k), HSA, and deductible IRA contributions reduce MAGI, potentially keeping it below the NIIT threshold.
- **Installment sales:** Spreading gain over multiple years via installment sale treatment can keep MAGI below the NIIT threshold in each year, whereas recognizing the full gain in one year would exceed it.
- **Charitable remainder trusts:** CRTs can defer capital gains recognition and spread income over the trust term, potentially reducing annual NIIT exposure.

---

## Above-the-Line Deductions (Adjustments to Gross Income)

These deductions reduce AGI directly, available regardless of whether the taxpayer itemizes or takes the standard deduction. They are particularly valuable because reducing AGI can also improve eligibility for other credits and deductions that have AGI-based phase-outs.

| Deduction | Maximum Amount | Key Requirements |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| HSA contributions | $4,300 self / $8,550 family | Must be HSA-eligible with HDHP |
| Traditional IRA | $7,000 / $8,000 (50+) | Subject to deductibility phase-outs if covered by employer plan |
| Student loan interest | $2,500 | MAGI phase-out: $80K-$95K single / $165K-$195K MFJ |
| Self-employed health insurance | 100% of premiums | Cannot exceed net SE income; not available if eligible for subsidized employer plan |
| One-half of self-employment tax | Calculated on SE income | Automatic — reported on Schedule SE |
| Educator expenses | $300 | K-12 teachers, instructors, counselors, principals, aides who work 900+ hours |
| No Tax on Tips (OBBBA) | $25,000 | Cash/service tips in tipped employee occupations, 2025-2028 |
| Overtime deduction (OBBBA) | $12,500 / $25,000 MFJ | FLSA-defined overtime for non-exempt employees, phases out at high income, 2025-2028 |
| Auto loan interest (OBBBA) | $10,000 | U.S.-assembled vehicle, income phase-outs apply, 2025-2028 |

## Expired and Terminated Credits — Key for 2025 Filing

The following credits were repealed or had their expiration accelerated by the OBBBA. Taxpayers who made qualifying purchases or installations **before** the termination dates may still claim these credits on their 2025 returns.

### Clean Vehicle Credit (Section 30D)

- **Terminated:** September 30, 2025
- New clean vehicles placed in service after this date do not qualify
- Previously owned (used) clean vehicle credit (Section 25E) also terminated on the same date
- Vehicles purchased and placed in service on or before September 30, 2025 remain eligible — claim on 2025 return

### Residential Energy Efficiency Credits

- **Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (Section 25C):** Terminated December 31, 2025
  - Covers qualifying insulation, windows, doors, heat pumps, water heaters, etc.
  - Improvements placed in service on or before December 31, 2025 are still eligible
- **Residential Clean Energy Credit (Section 25D):** Terminated December 31, 2025
  - Covers solar electric, solar water heating, battery storage, geothermal, wind
  - Systems placed in service on or before December 31, 2025 are still eligible
- These credits are **no longer available** for tax years beginning after 2025

---

## Key Planning Considerations for 2025

1. **OBBBA transition year:** Many OBBBA provisions take effect in 2025. Verify exact effective dates — some are retroactive to January 1, 2025, while others are effective from the date of enactment. Filing software should handle this, but manual calculations require care.

2. **SALT cap increase impact:** The jump from $10,000 to $40,000 is significant. Taxpayers in high-tax states who defaulted to the standard deduction under the $10K cap should recalculate. Many will now benefit from itemizing. Even in no-income-tax states, high property taxes combined with sales tax election may now exceed the standard deduction when combined with mortgage interest and charitable contributions.

3. **Senior bonus deduction optimization:** For clients age 65+ with MAGI near the $75,000/$150,000 threshold, identify strategies to reduce MAGI below the threshold: maximize pre-tax 401(k) contributions, HSA contributions, take advantage of above-the-line deductions. The $6,000 additional deduction at a 22% marginal rate saves $1,320 in tax.

4. **Roth conversion planning:** With TCJA rates now permanent, there is no "convert before rates increase" deadline. However, converting during lower-income years (early retirement, sabbatical, pre-RMD age) remains the optimal approach. Model multi-year conversion schedules to minimize lifetime tax.

5. **Tip and overtime documentation:** Workers eligible for the new tip and overtime deductions should ensure proper documentation. Tips must be reported through employer W-2 processes. Overtime must meet FLSA definitions. These deductions reduce income tax but not FICA.

6. **Energy credit deadline awareness:** Any planned energy improvements should have been completed and placed in service before the applicable termination dates. For 2025 returns, verify that installation was complete (placed in service) by the deadline, not merely contracted or paid for.

7. **Bracket management:** With permanent rates, multi-year income smoothing strategies (Roth conversions, capital gains harvesting, retirement account withdrawal sequencing) can be planned with greater confidence. Model taxable income across brackets to identify opportunities to fill lower brackets each year.
