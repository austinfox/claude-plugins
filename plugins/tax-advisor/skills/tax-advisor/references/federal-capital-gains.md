## Long-Term vs Short-Term Capital Gains

Capital gains are classified by **holding period**, measured from the day after acquisition to the date of sale.

**Short-term capital gains** apply to assets held for one year or less. These are taxed as ordinary income, meaning they stack on top of wages, interest, and other ordinary income and are subject to rates up to 37%.

**Long-term capital gains** apply to assets held for more than one year. They receive preferential tax rates:

| Rate | Single Filer | Married Filing Jointly |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| 0%   | Up to $48,350 | Up to $96,700 |
| 15%  | $48,351 - $533,400 | $96,701 - $600,050 |
| 20%  | Above $533,400 | Above $600,050 |

These thresholds are based on **taxable income**, not AGI. Long-term capital gains "stack" on top of ordinary income when determining which bracket applies. For example, a single filer with $40,000 of ordinary taxable income and $20,000 of long-term capital gains would have $8,350 of gains taxed at 0% and $11,650 taxed at 15%.

**Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT):** An additional 3.8% surtax applies to the lesser of net investment income or the amount by which MAGI exceeds $200,000 (single) or $250,000 (MFJ). These thresholds are **not indexed for inflation** and have remained unchanged since the NIIT was enacted in 2013. Net investment income includes capital gains, dividends, interest, rental income, and royalties.

**Special rate categories:**
- **Collectibles** (art, antiques, coins, stamps, precious metals, etc.): Maximum rate of 28% for long-term gains. Short-term gains are still taxed as ordinary income.
- **Unrecaptured Section 1250 gain** (depreciation on real estate): Maximum rate of 25%. This applies to the portion of gain on real property attributable to depreciation deductions previously taken. Any gain above the depreciation recapture is taxed at the standard long-term rates.

## Tax-Loss Harvesting

Tax-loss harvesting is the practice of selling investments at a loss to offset realized capital gains, thereby reducing current-year tax liability.

**Netting mechanics:** Losses offset gains dollar-for-dollar. Short-term losses first offset short-term gains; long-term losses first offset long-term gains. If one category produces a net loss and the other a net gain, they cross-offset.

**Excess loss deduction:** If total capital losses exceed total capital gains, up to $3,000 of net capital loss ($1,500 for Married Filing Separately) can be deducted against ordinary income per year. Unused losses carry forward indefinitely, retaining their short-term or long-term character.

**Methodology and timing:** Review your portfolio between October and December each year. Identify positions with unrealized losses. Consider the following:
- What gains have already been realized during the year?
- Are there positions with sufficient unrealized losses to offset those gains?
- Does selling the losing position still align with your investment strategy?
- Will the trade settle by December 31? For stocks and ETFs, settlement is T+1 (trade date plus one business day). A trade executed on December 30 settles on December 31. A trade executed on December 31 does not settle until January 2 and may not count for the current tax year.

**Wash sale considerations:** See the detailed wash sale section below. Any harvesting strategy must account for the 31-day replacement window.

## Wash Sale Rules (Detailed)

The wash sale rule under Section 1091 disallows a capital loss if the taxpayer purchases a "substantially identical" security within a **61-day window**: 30 days before through 30 days after the sale at a loss.

**Consequences of a wash sale:**
- The disallowed loss is added to the cost basis of the replacement shares.
- The holding period of the original (sold) shares tacks onto the replacement shares.
- The loss is not permanently destroyed in a taxable account — it is deferred until the replacement shares are eventually sold (assuming no subsequent wash sale).

**What is "substantially identical":**
- **Same stock or bond:** Buying the same company's stock within the window triggers a wash sale.
- **Same mutual fund or ETF:** Selling and repurchasing the same fund triggers a wash sale.
- **Different funds tracking different indices:** Generally NOT substantially identical. Selling an S&P 500 index fund and buying a total stock market fund is generally permissible, though the IRS has not provided definitive guidance on ETF/mutual fund comparisons.
- **ETF vs. mutual fund of the same index:** Switching between a Vanguard S&P 500 ETF and a Vanguard S&P 500 mutual fund may trigger a wash sale because they track the same index and hold substantially the same securities.
- **Options:** Buying a call option or selling a put option on the same stock can trigger a wash sale.

**Securities the wash sale rule applies to:** Stocks, bonds, options, mutual funds, ETFs.

**Securities the wash sale rule does NOT currently apply to:**
- Commodity futures (Section 1256 contracts have their own rules)
- Cryptocurrency (as of 2025, the IRS has indicated wash sale rules will apply to digital assets starting in 2026 under the broker reporting regulations, but for 2025 transactions, the wash sale rule technically does not apply to crypto — though this area is evolving)
- Real estate

**Cross-account wash sales:** The wash sale rule applies across ALL of the taxpayer's accounts. This includes:
- Multiple brokerage accounts
- IRAs and Roth IRAs
- A spouse's accounts (when filing jointly)

**Critical IRA trap:** If you sell a stock at a loss in a taxable account and buy it back within 31 days in an IRA, the loss is permanently disallowed. Because IRAs do not track cost basis for tax purposes, the basis adjustment that normally preserves the deferred loss provides no benefit. The loss is effectively destroyed.

**Harvesting strategy:** Sell the losing position, immediately buy a similar but not substantially identical replacement to maintain market exposure, then wait at least 31 days before repurchasing the original security if desired.

## 0% Capital Gains Bracket Harvesting

Taxpayers with low taxable income can intentionally realize long-term capital gains and pay zero federal tax, effectively resetting their cost basis to current fair market value.

**Income thresholds for 2025 (combining standard deduction and 0% bracket ceiling):**
- **Single:** $15,750 standard deduction + $48,350 = $64,100 total gross income before any LTCG tax
- **Married Filing Jointly:** $31,500 standard deduction + $96,700 = $128,200 total gross income before any LTCG tax

A taxpayer whose total income (including the harvested gains) stays below these levels pays 0% federal tax on the long-term gains and gets a stepped-up basis.

**Ideal candidates:**
- Retirees living on savings before Social Security or RMDs begin
- Individuals on sabbatical or between jobs
- Years with unusually large itemized deductions
- Early retirees in the "gap years" before age 65/Medicare
- Students or part-time workers with investment portfolios

**Combination with Roth conversions:** Fill ordinary income brackets with a Roth IRA conversion (which is taxed as ordinary income), then fill the remaining 0% long-term capital gains bracket with harvested gains. This allows both a Roth conversion and a tax-free basis step-up in the same year.

**Caution:** Harvested gains increase MAGI, which can affect ACA premium subsidies, Medicare IRMAA surcharges, and taxation of Social Security benefits. Model the full impact before executing.

## Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) — Section 1202

Section 1202 provides an exclusion of gain on the sale of qualified small business stock, potentially eliminating federal capital gains tax entirely.

**Exclusion amount:** The greater of $10 million or 10 times the taxpayer's adjusted basis in the stock. For stock acquired after September 27, 2010, the exclusion is 100%. Stock acquired between February 18, 2009 and September 27, 2010 qualifies for a 75% exclusion. Stock acquired before that date qualifies for a 50% exclusion.

**Requirements for QSBS:**
- Issued by a **domestic C corporation** (not an S corp, LLC, or partnership).
- The corporation had **aggregate gross assets of $50 million or less** at the time the stock was issued (and at all times before issuance).
- The stock was acquired at **original issuance** (directly from the company, not on a secondary market) in exchange for money, property, or services.
- The taxpayer held the stock for **more than 5 years**.
- The corporation uses at least 80% of its assets in an **active trade or business** (not a passive investment holding company).
- **Excluded businesses:** Health, law, engineering, architecture, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts, consulting, athletics, financial services, brokerage, or any business where the principal asset is the reputation or skill of employees — unless the corporation has $50M or less in gross assets at issuance (the service business exclusion primarily targets larger professional services firms).

**AMT treatment:** For stock acquired after September 27, 2010, the 100% exclusion also applies for Alternative Minimum Tax purposes. No AMT preference item is generated.

**Stacking exclusions:** Each taxpayer gets their own $10 million exclusion per qualifying issuer. Married couples filing jointly each get $10 million, for a combined $20 million exclusion on the same company's stock.

**Gifting strategy:** QSBS status transfers with gifted stock, though the recipient must satisfy the 5-year holding period (which includes the donor's holding period). Gifting QSBS to family members can multiply the number of $10 million exclusions available for a single company's stock.

**Documentation:** Maintain records proving the $50 million gross asset test was met at the time of stock issuance. Obtain a representation from the company. Track the original issuance date and basis carefully.

## Installment Sales — Section 453

Installment sales allow taxpayers to spread gain recognition over the period in which payments are received, rather than recognizing all gain in the year of sale.

**Mechanics:** Each payment received is treated as consisting partly of return of basis, partly of gain, and partly of interest. The gross profit ratio (gain divided by contract price) determines the taxable portion of each principal payment.

**Restrictions — installment method cannot be used for:**
- Publicly traded securities
- Inventory sales
- Depreciation recapture (Section 1245 and 1250 recapture is recognized entirely in the year of sale, even if payments are received later)
- Dealer dispositions

**Interest requirements:** The seller must charge interest at least equal to the Applicable Federal Rate (AFR). If interest is below AFR, the IRS imputes interest, recharacterizing part of the principal as interest income.

**Related party rules:** If the buyer is a related party (family member, controlled entity) and resells the property within 2 years, the original seller must accelerate gain recognition as if all remaining payments were received.

**Electing out:** A taxpayer can elect to recognize all gain in the year of sale on a timely filed return. This may be beneficial if the taxpayer expects to be in a higher tax bracket in future years, wants to use losses in the current year, or prefers certainty.

## Opportunity Zones — Section 1400Z-2

Qualified Opportunity Zone (QOZ) investments allow taxpayers to defer and potentially reduce capital gains taxes.

**Mechanism:** Invest capital gains into a Qualified Opportunity Zone Fund within 180 days of realization. The original gain is deferred until December 31, 2026 (or earlier sale of the OZ investment).

**2025 status:** The deferral benefit is diminished for new investments because the original deferred gain is recognized on December 31, 2026 regardless. The basis step-up incentives for 5-year and 7-year holds expired (those deadlines passed in 2021 and 2019 respectively). However, the **10-year appreciation exclusion** remains valuable: if the OZ investment is held for at least 10 years, all appreciation on the OZ investment itself is excluded from tax (basis is stepped up to FMV at the time of sale or exchange).

**Requirements:** The investment must be an equity interest (not debt) in a Qualified Opportunity Zone Fund. The fund must hold at least 90% of its assets in qualified opportunity zone property.

## Charitable Strategies for Capital Gains

**Donate appreciated stock directly:** Transfer long-term appreciated securities to a charity. The taxpayer deducts the full fair market value and avoids recognizing the capital gain entirely. The stock must have been held for more than one year. The deduction is limited to 30% of AGI, with a 5-year carry-forward for excess.

**Donor-Advised Fund (DAF):** Contribute appreciated stock to a DAF in a single year, claim the full deduction, and distribute grants to charities over subsequent years. This allows front-loading the tax benefit into a high-income year while spreading charitable giving over time.

**Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT):** Transfer appreciated assets into an irrevocable CRT. The trust sells the assets without recognizing gain immediately (the trust is tax-exempt on the sale). The trust pays the donor an income stream for life or a term of years, and the remainder passes to charity. Distributions to the donor are taxed under a tier system: ordinary income first, then capital gains, then tax-exempt income, then return of principal.

**Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD):** Available to taxpayers age 70 1/2 or older. Up to $105,000 (2025 limit) can be distributed directly from an IRA to a qualified charity. The distribution counts toward the Required Minimum Distribution but is not included in AGI. While not directly a capital gains strategy, reducing AGI can lower exposure to the 3.8% NIIT by bringing MAGI below the $200,000/$250,000 threshold.

## Specific Lot Identification and Netting Rules

**Default method:** FIFO (first in, first out). The earliest-purchased shares are deemed sold first. This often results in the highest gains because the oldest shares typically have the lowest cost basis.

**Specific identification:** The taxpayer designates exactly which shares (by purchase date and price) are being sold. This must be done **before the trade settles**. Most brokerages support specific lot identification and allow you to set it as the default cost basis method.

**Strategy applications:**
- Sell **highest-basis shares first** to minimize current-year gain.
- Sell **lowest-basis shares** intentionally when in the 0% long-term capital gains bracket to harvest gains tax-free.
- Select specific lots to ensure long-term (rather than short-term) holding period treatment.

**Mutual fund exception:** Mutual fund shareholders can use the **average cost method**, which averages the basis of all shares. However, once average cost is elected for a fund, the taxpayer generally cannot switch back to specific identification for shares already covered by the election.

**Netting rules summary:**
1. Short-term gains and short-term losses net against each other.
2. Long-term gains and long-term losses net against each other.
3. If one category has a net gain and the other has a net loss, they offset each other.
4. Net short-term capital gain is taxed as ordinary income.
5. Net long-term capital gain is taxed at the preferential rates (0%/15%/20%).
6. Net capital loss: deduct up to $3,000 against ordinary income ($1,500 MFS). Excess carries forward indefinitely, retaining its short-term or long-term character.

## Washington State Capital Gains Tax Interaction

Washington State imposes a capital gains excise tax on the sale of long-term financial assets (stocks, bonds, etc.).

**2025 rates and thresholds:**
- 7% on long-term capital gains above $278,000 (up to $1 million)
- 9.9% on the portion of long-term capital gains exceeding $1 million
- Applies only to financial assets — real estate and retirement account distributions are excluded

**Federal interaction:** The WA capital gains tax is classified as an excise tax, not an income tax. It is **not deductible** as a state income tax for federal purposes under the SALT deduction. However, it may be deductible as a business expense if the gains are from business-related assets.

**Planning considerations:**
- A taxpayer can be in the federal 0% long-term capital gains bracket but still owe WA capital gains tax if gains exceed the $278,000 threshold. These are independent calculations.
- Consider spreading asset sales across multiple tax years to stay below the WA threshold each year.
- WA allows a charitable deduction of up to $111,000 for contributions to Washington-based nonprofits, which reduces the amount of gains subject to the WA tax.
- Coordinate federal tax-loss harvesting with WA exposure — losses that offset gains also reduce WA taxable capital gains.

## Section 1256 Contracts

Section 1256 provides special tax treatment for certain financial contracts, including regulated futures contracts, foreign currency contracts, non-equity options (such as options on broad-based indices), and dealer equity options.

**60/40 rule:** Regardless of actual holding period, gains and losses on Section 1256 contracts are treated as 60% long-term and 40% short-term. This produces a blended maximum federal rate of approximately 26.8% (60% x 20% + 40% x 37%) compared to 37% for short-term gains.

**Mark-to-market:** All open Section 1256 positions are treated as if sold at fair market value on the last business day of the tax year. Gains and losses are recognized annually even if the position remains open.

**Loss carryback:** Net Section 1256 losses can be carried back 3 years and applied against Section 1256 gains in those years (but only Section 1256 gains). This is unique — ordinary capital losses cannot be carried back.

**Strategy:** Use options on broad-based indices (SPX options, for example) rather than options on individual stocks or narrow-based ETFs (SPY options) to qualify for the favorable 60/40 treatment. SPX options are Section 1256 contracts; SPY options are not.
