## No State Income Tax — Strategic Advantages

Washington is one of nine states with no broad-based personal income tax. This creates several high-value planning opportunities that should inform nearly every major financial decision for WA residents.

**Roth Conversions at Zero State Cost.** Converting traditional IRA or 401(k) balances to Roth accounts triggers federal income tax (10-37% depending on bracket) but zero state income tax. Compare this to California (9.3-13.3%), New York (8.82-10.9%), Oregon (8.75-9.9%), or Minnesota (5.35-9.85%). A WA resident converting $100,000 from traditional to Roth saves $9,300-$13,300 in state taxes compared to a California resident in the top bracket. This makes Washington one of the best states in the country for executing large Roth conversion ladders, particularly in early retirement years, during career transitions, or before large income increases. If a client may move TO an income-tax state in the future, prioritize Roth conversions now while in WA. Conversely, if they moved FROM an income-tax state, defer income recognition to WA years when possible.

**Retirement Income Fully Untaxed.** Social Security benefits, pension income, 401(k)/IRA distributions, and annuity payments face no state-level taxation. Retirees in Washington keep 100% of their retirement income from state income tax, regardless of the amount withdrawn. Traditional 401(k)/IRA contributions save federal tax only — there is no state deduction to capture, which makes the Roth vs. Traditional decision simpler: if current and future federal marginal rates are similar, Roth wins because of flexibility and no RMD requirements.

**Remote Workers.** WA residents generally owe no state income tax even when working for employers based in states with income taxes. However, workers should verify that the employer's state does not impose a "convenience of the employer" rule (as New York does). In most cases, physical presence in Washington while performing work means Washington's no-income-tax regime applies.

**Capital Gains Planning.** Short-term capital gains face no state income tax whatsoever. Long-term capital gains from financial assets are subject only to the WA capital gains excise tax if they exceed the $278,000 standard deduction threshold — a far more favorable treatment than income-tax states that tax all gains at ordinary rates.

## Capital Gains Tax (2025, Post-SB 5813 — Signed May 20, 2025)

Washington's capital gains tax, originally enacted in 2021 as a flat 7% rate and upheld by the WA Supreme Court in March 2023, was significantly restructured by SB 5813 with changes retroactive to January 1, 2025.

**Standard Deduction:** $278,000 in net long-term capital gains from financial assets (indexed annually for inflation). Only gains exceeding this threshold are taxable. Joint filers are treated as a single unit — there is no marriage bonus or doubling of the deduction.

**NEW Tiered Rate Structure (Retroactive to January 1, 2025):**
- 7% on the first $1,000,000 of taxable gains (gains above the $278,000 deduction)
- 9.9% on taxable gains exceeding $1,000,000

For example, a taxpayer with $1,500,000 in qualifying long-term gains would have $1,222,000 in taxable gains ($1,500,000 minus $278,000 deduction). Tax owed: 7% on the first $1,000,000 ($70,000) plus 9.9% on the remaining $222,000 ($21,978), totaling $91,978.

**Charitable Deduction:** Up to $111,000 may be deducted for donations made to Washington-qualified charitable organizations. Only WA-based nonprofits qualify (not national organizations unless they have a WA chapter). This is separate from the federal charitable deduction and is in addition to the standard deduction.

**What Is Included:** Gains from the sale or exchange of stocks, bonds, and other financial assets. RSU vesting and ISO exercises can create WA-taxable gains — plan vesting schedules and sales around the $278K threshold.

**What Is EXCLUDED:**
- Real estate (all types — residential, commercial, investment)
- Retirement account distributions (401(k), IRA, etc.)
- Livestock, timber, and commercial fishing
- Federally taxed timber gains
- Goodwill from the sale of an auto dealership

**Filing Threshold:** A return is required only if net long-term gains from financial assets equal or exceed $278,000 in the tax year. Filed with WA DOR (not IRS), due April 15. Estimated payments may be required if liability exceeds threshold.

**Planning Strategies:**
1. **Harvest gains below the $278,000 threshold** each year to take full advantage of the deduction. A filer can realize up to $278,000 in long-term financial asset gains annually with zero WA capital gains tax.
2. **Time sales across tax years** to keep each year's gains under the threshold or within the 7% bracket (under $1,278,000 total gains).
3. **Use the charitable deduction** strategically — donating appreciated stock to WA-qualified nonprofits can reduce both federal and WA capital gains tax simultaneously.
4. **Consider installment sales** to spread gain recognition across multiple years, potentially keeping each year below the threshold.
5. **Coordinate with federal capital gains brackets** — the 0%/15%/20% federal rate brackets should inform the timing and amount of gain recognition alongside WA thresholds.
6. **Prioritize real estate gains over stock sales** when possible — real estate is fully excluded from WA capital gains tax while stocks are taxed.

## B&O Tax (Post-SB 5813/HB 2081 — Signed May 20, 2025)

Washington's Business & Occupation (B&O) tax is a gross receipts tax — it applies to gross revenue, not profit. This means businesses owe B&O tax even in years they lose money. No deduction for cost of goods sold or business expenses (with limited exceptions).

**Service & Other Activities (Major Category for Consultants, Tech, Professional Services):**
- Gross income under $1,000,000: 1.5% (unchanged)
- Gross income $1,000,000 to $5,000,000: 1.75% (effective October 1, 2025)
- Gross income over $5,000,000: 2.1% (effective October 1, 2025)

**Retailing, Manufacturing, and Wholesaling:** Current rates of 0.471-0.484% increase to a flat 0.5% effective January 1, 2027.

**NEW 0.5% Surcharge:** An additional 0.5% surcharge applies to businesses with Washington taxable income exceeding $250,000,000 per year, effective January 1, 2026.

**Advanced Computing Surcharge:** The surcharge on advanced computing (primarily targeting companies with $100B+ global revenue) increases dramatically from 1.22% to 7.5%, effective January 1, 2026. Combined with the base service rate, qualifying large tech firms could face an effective B&O rate exceeding 9%. This is one of the most significant tax increases in the SB 5813 package.

**Financial Institution Surcharge:** Increases from 1.2% to 1.5%, effective October 1, 2025.

**Small Business B&O Credit:** Businesses with gross income of $125,000 per year or less receive a full credit eliminating their B&O tax liability. The credit phases out between $125,000 and $250,000 in gross income. No credit above $250,000.

**City B&O Taxes:** Seattle, Bellingham, Tacoma, Bellevue, Everett, and several other municipalities impose their own local B&O taxes on top of the state tax. Seattle's rate is approximately 0.415% for most services. Businesses must register with and file returns in each city where they have nexus.

**Multiple Activities Tax Credit (MATC):** Prevents double-taxation when a single transaction could be classified under multiple B&O categories (e.g., manufacturing and selling the same product).

**Classification Matters:** Correct classification is critical. A business misclassified as "Service & Other Activities" instead of "Retailing" could pay more than triple the correct rate. If a business creates a physical product, the manufacturing rate (0.484%) is much lower than service (1.5%). Software can sometimes qualify as manufacturing. Review classifications annually, especially if business activities change.

**Nexus:** A business has B&O tax obligations in Washington if it has physical presence in the state or more than $100,000 in gross receipts sourced to Washington. Income from sales to out-of-state customers may be deductible depending on nexus and apportionment rules.

## PFML (Paid Family & Medical Leave, 2025)

**Total Premium Rate:** 0.92% of gross wages (increased from 0.74% in 2024).

**Split:**
- Employee share: 71.52% of the total premium, approximately 0.658% of wages
- Employer share: 28.48% of the total premium, approximately 0.262% of wages

**Wage Cap:** $176,100 (tied to the Social Security wage base for 2025). Premiums are not assessed on wages above this cap.

**Small Employer Exemption:** Employers with fewer than 50 employees in Washington are exempt from the employer portion of the premium. Their employees still pay the employee share.

**Maximum Weekly Benefit:** $1,542 per week for qualifying leave.

**2026 Rate:** The premium rate is scheduled to increase to 1.13% in 2026.

**TAX PLANNING:** Employee PFML premiums are deductible as state and local taxes on federal Schedule A, subject to the SALT deduction cap. Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), the SALT cap increases to $40,000 for 2025, which allows more WA taxpayers to benefit from this deduction. At maximum taxable wages ($176,100), the employee PFML premium totals approximately $1,159 per year. This is a meaningful component of the SALT deduction for Washington residents who otherwise have limited state tax deductions (no income tax). Include PFML premiums in your SALT calculation when deciding standard vs. itemized. Combined with property tax, sales tax election, and PFML, WA residents may now reach the SALT cap more often under the $40K OBBBA limit.

---

## WA Cares Fund (Long-Term Care, 2025)

**Premium Rate:** 0.58% of gross wages with NO wage cap. Unlike PFML, there is no ceiling — the premium applies to every dollar of W-2 wages. A worker earning $200,000 pays $1,160 per year. A worker earning $500,000 pays $2,900 per year. At $1,000,000 in wages, WA Cares alone is $5,800.

**Funding:** 100% employee-paid. Employers are not responsible for any portion.

**Opt-Out:** The opt-out window for workers who purchased qualifying private long-term care insurance closed permanently on December 31, 2022. There is no current path to opt out based on private coverage.

**New Exemptions (SB 5291, Effective January 1, 2026):**
- Born before January 1, 1968 (workers approaching retirement who would not vest in benefits)
- Military spouses
- Non-immigrant visa holders (H-1B, L-1, and similar categories)
- Workers whose permanent address is outside Washington
- Veterans with 70% or greater service-connected disability rating

**Benefit:** Up to $36,500 in lifetime long-term care benefits, available starting July 2026. Benefits are accessed through approved long-term care providers for services such as in-home care, assisted living, and nursing care. Must have contributed for 10 years (or 3 of the last 6 years) to be fully vested.

**TAX PLANNING:** WA Cares premiums may qualify as deductible state taxes on federal Schedule A (subject to SALT cap). At a $200,000 salary, WA Cares costs $1,160 per year. Combined with PFML employee premiums ($1,159 at the wage cap), total deductible Washington payroll taxes can exceed $2,300 per year. For high earners, the uncapped nature of WA Cares means this tax scales linearly with total W-2 compensation. Note: WA Cares premiums are not deductible as a medical expense — they are classified as a payroll tax, not an insurance premium.

## Sales Tax

**State Rate:** 6.5%.

**Local Rates:** Additional 1-4% imposed by cities, counties, and special taxing districts. Combined rates commonly exceed 10% in urban areas (Seattle's combined rate is 10.25% as of 2025).

**NEW Expansion (SB 5814, Effective October 1, 2025):** Sales tax has been expanded to cover several previously exempt service categories:
- IT services and custom web/software development
- Security and investigation services
- Temporary staffing services
- Data processing and hosting services
- Advertising services
- Live presentations and event services

**Use Tax:** Washington imposes a use tax at the same combined rate as sales tax on purchases made from out-of-state sellers when no sales tax was collected. This applies to online purchases, out-of-state business equipment, and other acquisitions.

**Business Impact:** Service businesses that were previously exempt from collecting sales tax (such as IT consultancies, web developers, and staffing agencies) must now register for sales tax collection and remittance. This affects pricing, contracts, and cash flow. Review existing contracts for tax pass-through provisions. Consider completing contracts for newly-taxable services before October 1, 2025 when possible. Account for use tax obligations on services purchased from out-of-state vendors.

## Property Tax

**Assessment Basis:** Properties are assessed at 100% of fair market value by the county assessor. WA property tax is a levy-based system — rates are calculated to raise a specific amount of revenue, not a fixed percentage.

**Rate:** Varies by location, typically ranging from $8 to $15 per $1,000 of assessed value (effective rates of 0.8-1.2%). The rate is a composite of state, county, city, school district, and special district levies.

**1% Levy Limit:** Regular property tax levies are limited to a 1% annual increase, though new construction and voter-approved levies can increase the total tax beyond this limit.

**Senior/Disabled Exemption:** Available to homeowners aged 61 or older, or those who are disabled, with household income meeting threshold requirements (varies by county). Reduces assessed value or exempts property from certain levies depending on income level. Must be claimed proactively — not applied automatically.

**Property Tax Deferral:** Qualifying seniors and disabled homeowners can defer property tax payments until the home is sold or transferred. Deferred taxes accrue interest (currently 5%) and become a lien on the property.

**No Homestead Exemption:** Unlike many states, Washington does not offer a general homestead exemption.

**TAX PLANNING:** Property tax is deductible on federal Schedule A, subject to the $40,000 SALT cap (OBBBA). For many WA residents, property tax is the largest component of their SALT deduction. Appeal assessed value if it exceeds current market value — assessor valuations are not always accurate, and a successful appeal can reduce taxes for multiple years. Deadline for appeals is typically 60 days from notice of assessed value (July-August for most counties). Bring comparable sales data and evidence of value impairment.

## Estate Tax (Post-SB 5813 — Signed May 20, 2025)

Washington's estate tax underwent substantial revision in SB 5813, creating a bifurcated system for 2025.

**Exclusion Amounts:**
- Deaths occurring January 1 through June 30, 2025: $2,193,000 exclusion
- Deaths occurring after June 30, 2025: $3,000,000 exclusion (indexed for inflation starting 2026 — estimated at $3,076,000 for 2026)

**NEW Rate Structure (Deaths After June 30, 2025):**

| Taxable Estate | Rate |
|---------------|------|
| $0 - $1M | 10% |
| $1M - $2M | 14% |
| $2M - $3M | 15% |
| $3M - $4M | 16% |
| $4M - $6M | 18% |
| $6M - $7M | 19% |
| $7M - $9M | 19.5% |
| Over $9M | **35%** |

**Impact Analysis:**
- Estates under approximately $8,800,000: pay LESS under the new law than under the prior structure (due to the higher exclusion from $2.193M to $3M)
- Estates over approximately $8,800,000: pay MORE due to the new 35% top rate (previously capped at 20%)

**NO Spousal Portability:** Unlike the federal estate tax, Washington does NOT allow a surviving spouse to use the deceased spouse's unused exclusion amount. Each spouse has only their own $3,000,000 exclusion. This makes proper estate planning for married couples essential — assets must be structured so both exclusions are utilized.

**Community Property Note:** WA is a community property state — half of community property belongs to each spouse. At death, both halves of community property receive a stepped-up basis (double step-up). This is a significant advantage over common-law states where only the decedent's half gets a step-up.

**Planning Strategies:**
- **Credit shelter (bypass) trust:** Essential for married couples. Split assets so each spouse uses their $3M exclusion. Without planning, the first spouse's exclusion is wasted due to no portability.
- **Lifetime gifting** to reduce the taxable estate below the $3,000,000 exclusion. Washington has no state gift tax, so gifts during life escape both WA estate tax and potential future appreciation. Use the federal $19,000 annual exclusion to systematically transfer wealth.
- **Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust (ILIT):** Removes life insurance proceeds from the taxable estate. A $2,000,000 policy inside an ILIT is excluded from both federal and WA estate calculations.
- **Qualified Personal Residence Trust (QPRT):** Transfers a home to heirs at a reduced gift tax value while allowing the grantor to continue living in it for a set term.
- **Family Limited Partnership (FLP):** Can achieve valuation discounts of 20-35% on transferred assets due to lack of marketability and minority interest discounts.
- **Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT):** Provides an income stream during life, a charitable deduction, and removes assets from the estate.
- **Domicile review:** If estate exceeds $3M, evaluate whether WA residence is optimal. States with no estate tax include NV, TX, FL, AZ, WY, SD.
- **Critical Context:** The federal estate tax exclusion is $13,990,000 for 2025, meaning Washington's $3,000,000 exclusion catches far more estates. This is especially relevant in King County, where median home values exceed $800,000 and many long-term homeowners hold significant equity. A couple with a $6,000,000 estate — common among Seattle-area homeowners with retirement accounts — would owe zero federal estate tax but could face a significant WA estate tax bill without planning.

## Key Interactions with Federal Tax

**SALT Deduction:** Washington residents can count the following toward the $40,000 SALT cap (OBBBA, 2025):
- Property taxes (often the largest component for WA residents)
- PFML employee premiums (~$1,159 at max wages)
- WA Cares premiums (uncapped — scales with wages)
- State and local sales taxes (either actual amount or IRS table amount)

Residents must choose between deducting sales tax OR income tax on Schedule A. Since WA has no income tax, always elect the sales tax deduction.

**Roth Conversion Advantage:** The absence of state income tax makes Roth conversions uniquely attractive. The only tax cost is federal (10-37%). In California, the same conversion costs an additional 9.3-13.3% in state tax. Prioritize large Roth conversions while residing in WA.

**WA Capital Gains Tax and Federal Deductibility:** The WA capital gains tax is classified as an excise tax, not an income tax. It is NOT deductible as a state income tax on Schedule A. However, current IRS guidance should be verified, as this classification has been challenged in court. If the tax were reclassified as an income tax for federal purposes, it could become deductible subject to the SALT cap.

**B&O Tax Deductibility:** B&O tax paid by businesses is deductible as an ordinary business expense on Schedule C (sole proprietors) or as part of business operating expenses for other entity types. Critically, this deduction is NOT subject to the SALT cap — it reduces business income directly. This makes the B&O tax less burdensome in after-tax terms than its gross-receipts basis might suggest.

**Dual Estate Tax Planning:** Estates must plan for both the federal exclusion ($13,990,000) and the WA exclusion ($3,000,000) separately. An estate of $5,000,000 owes zero federal estate tax but faces WA estate tax on $2,000,000. The lack of spousal portability at the state level means married couples need bypass trust or disclaimer trust planning to preserve both WA exclusions — a step that is unnecessary at the federal level for estates under $27,980,000 (combined exclusion for married couples).
