## January

### Tax Forms Arrive

- **W-2s** and **1099s** are due to taxpayers by **January 31**. Watch for: 1099-INT, 1099-DIV, 1099-B, 1099-NEC, 1099-MISC, 1099-R, 1099-K.
- **1095-A/B/C** (health coverage forms) also arrive in January. 1095-A is critical if you had Marketplace coverage — needed for Form 8962 (Premium Tax Credit reconciliation).
- Do not file until you have received all expected forms. Amended returns are costly in time and complexity.

### Prior Year Review

- Did you max your **401(k)**? **HSA**? **IRA**? If not, note the shortfall and plan to correct it this year.
- Review your prior year effective tax rate and marginal bracket. This anchors all current-year planning.

### Set New Year Contribution Rates

- **401(k) elections:** update payroll to max **$23,500** employee deferral ($31,000 if age 50+, **$34,750** if age 60-63 under SECURE 2.0 super catch-up).
- **HSA payroll deductions:** set to max **$4,300** self-only / **$8,550** family (+$1,000 catch-up if age 55+). Payroll contributions avoid FICA — worth approximately 7.65% more than direct contributions.
- **FSA elections** (if not already locked during open enrollment): health FSA **$3,300**, dependent care FSA **$5,000**. FSAs are use-it-or-lose-it, except employers may allow a **$660 carryover** for health FSA balances.

### Withholding Review

- Review your **W-4** withholding, especially after life changes (marriage, divorce, new child, job change, spouse starting/stopping work). Use the **IRS Tax Withholding Estimator** (irs.gov/W4app) for precision.
- If you owed a large balance or received a large refund last year, your withholding needs adjustment.

### Key Deadline

- **January 15:** Q4 estimated tax payment due for the **prior year** (Form 1040-ES). You can skip this payment if you file your return and pay the full balance due by **January 31**.

### Strategic Consideration

- **Roth conversion planning** for the new year begins now. Project your expected income and identify conversion opportunities — particularly if you anticipate a lower-income year (job transition, sabbatical, early retirement).

---

## February

### Document Organization

- All tax documents should be received by **mid-February**. If missing, contact the issuer — do not wait until April.
- Organize and cross-check: **W-2**, **1099-INT/DIV/B/NEC/MISC/R**, **K-1** (may arrive later), **1098** (mortgage interest), **property tax records**, **1095-A**.
- Gather deduction documentation: **charitable receipts** (noncash over $500 requires Form 8283), **medical expenses** (relevant only if exceeding 7.5% of AGI), **business expense records**.

### Self-Employment

- If self-employed, **finalize prior year books** and prepare for Schedule C. Reconcile bank statements and calculate net self-employment income.

### Strategic Consideration

- **File early** if expecting a refund — reduces identity theft risk and accelerates your refund.

---

## March

### K-1 Season

- **K-1s** from partnerships, S-Corps, and trusts are due to recipients by **March 15** (the entity filing deadline). These are frequently late — if you are a partner or shareholder, follow up proactively.
- K-1 income can significantly affect your tax picture. Do not finalize your return until all K-1s are received.

### Key Deadline

- **March 15:** S-Corp and partnership returns due (**Form 1120-S**, **Form 1065**) — or file extension (**Form 7004**).
- **S-Corp election** (Form 2553): due **March 15** for current-year election, or within 75 days of entity formation.

### Strategic Consideration

- If you have all documents in hand, **start preparing your return**. Early preparation gives you time to identify planning opportunities before the April 15 deadline forces last-minute decisions.

---

## April

### Key Deadlines — April 15

- **April 15:** Individual tax return due (**Form 1040**) — or file extension (**Form 4868**, automatic 6 months to Oct 15).
- **April 15:** Last day for **prior year IRA contributions** — $7,000 + $1,000 catch-up if age 50+. Hard deadline regardless of extensions.
- **April 15:** Last day for **prior year HSA contributions** — $4,300/$8,550 + $1,000 catch-up if age 55+. Also a hard deadline.
- **April 15:** **Q1 estimated tax payment** due for the current year.

### Critical Distinction

- An **extension to file is NOT an extension to pay**. Interest and late payment penalties (0.5%/month, up to 25%) accrue on unpaid balances from April 15. If requesting an extension, **pay your estimated balance due** to minimize penalties.

### Strategic Consideration

- Even if filing an extension, make **IRA and HSA contributions by April 15** — you cannot get this time back.
- If near the Roth IRA income phase-out ($150,000-$165,000 single, $236,000-$246,000 MFJ), confirm eligibility before contributing directly. Consider a **backdoor Roth** if over the limit.

---

## May

### Post-Filing Review

- Review your filed return (or extension): did you miss any deductions or credits? Catch errors now while details are fresh.
- If extended, continue gathering documents — especially **late K-1s** from complex entities.

### Mid-Year Check-In

- Review **YTD income vs. full-year projections**. Are your estimated payments and withholding on track to cover your expected liability?
- If income is higher than expected, **increase estimated payments or adjust W-4 withholding** now rather than waiting until year-end.

---

## June

### Key Deadline

- **June 15:** Q2 estimated tax payment due.

### Mid-Year Tax Projection

- Perform a **formal mid-year tax projection**: estimate full-year income from all sources, calculate expected total tax liability, and compare against withholding plus estimated payments already made.
- **RSU vesting check:** review YTD RSU vesting and confirm withholding is adequate. The default 22% supplemental rate is often **insufficient for high earners** — if your marginal rate is 32%+ you will likely owe a substantial balance without adjustment.

### Strategic Consideration

- **Roth conversion opportunity:** if income is tracking lower than expected (due to a job change, leave, or variable compensation), this may be an ideal year for a larger Roth conversion while you occupy a lower tax bracket.

---

## July-August

### Summer Review

- Assess any **major transactions**: home sale (Section 121 exclusion: $250K single / $500K MFJ — must meet 2-of-5-year ownership and use tests), significant stock sales, business changes.

### Benefits Planning

- **Open enrollment prep:** begin evaluating health plan choices for next year. Switching to/from an HDHP affects HSA eligibility.
- **529 plan contributions** and **education credits** (AOTC up to $2,500, LLC up to $2,000): review eligibility and plan contributions.

### Strategic Consideration

- If self-employed, review **retirement plan contributions** (SEP-IRA, Solo 401(k)) and adjust if business income is trending differently than projected.

---

## September

### Key Deadlines

- **September 15:** Q3 estimated tax payment due.
- **September 15:** Extended **S-Corp and partnership returns** due (final deadline — no further extension available).

### Fall Tax Planning Push

- The **year-end planning window opens now**. You still have nearly four months to take meaningful action.
- Review **capital gains and losses** across your portfolio. Begin identifying **tax-loss harvesting** candidates — positions with unrealized losses that can offset realized gains.
- Watch the **wash sale rule**: you cannot repurchase a "substantially identical" security within 30 days before or after the sale and still claim the loss.

### Strategic Consideration

- If your itemized deductions are close to the standard deduction threshold ($15,750 single / $31,500 MFJ), consider **bunching charitable deductions** — concentrate two years of giving into one year to exceed the standard deduction, then take the standard deduction in the alternate year.

---

## October

### Key Deadline

- **October 15:** Extended individual returns due — **HARD DEADLINE**. No further extensions are available. Failure to file triggers a 5% per month penalty (up to 25%) on the unpaid balance, in addition to late payment penalties.

### Open Enrollment Season

- Employer and **Marketplace** open enrollment begin.
- **Health plan selection:** evaluate HDHP for HSA eligibility. Review updated deductible and out-of-pocket limits for the coming year.
- **FSA election:** carefully estimate next year's medical and dependent care expenses. Over-funding wastes money; under-funding leaves tax savings on the table.
- **ESPP enrollment:** review discount percentage and holding period rules affecting ordinary income vs. capital gains treatment.

### Strategic Consideration

- **Roth conversion window:** by October, you know most of the year's income. This is the optimal time to calculate your remaining bracket space and execute a precise Roth conversion to fill it.

---

## November

### Open Enrollment Decisions

- Employer open enrollment decisions are typically due **mid-November**. Finalize health plan, FSA, HSA, and other benefit elections.

### Tax-Loss Harvesting Execution

- Execute tax-loss harvesting trades by **mid-December** at the latest. With T+1 settlement, trades must settle by December 31, meaning the trade date deadline is effectively **December 30**.
- Remember to account for wash sale implications across all accounts (including your spouse's accounts and IRAs).

### Charitable Giving Strategy

- If **itemizing**, maximize deductions before year-end. If **not itemizing**, consider bunching into a single year or using a **donor-advised fund (DAF)**.
- **Donate appreciated stock** held longer than one year: avoid capital gains tax entirely and deduct the full fair market value (up to 30% of AGI for appreciated property).
- **Donor-Advised Fund (DAF):** contribute appreciated stock, take the full charitable deduction this year, then distribute grants to charities over time. Powerful for bunching.

### 401(k) Check

- Review **YTD 401(k) contributions**: are you on track to max the $23,500 limit (or $31,000/$34,750 with catch-up)? If not, increase your deferral percentage for the remaining paychecks. Some plans allow a true-up, but many do not — running the math now avoids leaving employer match on the table.

### Strategic Consideration

- **Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD):** if age 70 1/2 or older, you can distribute up to **$105,000** directly from an IRA to a qualified charity. The QCD counts toward your RMD, is excluded from AGI, and is more tax-efficient than taking the distribution and claiming a charitable deduction.

## December

### December 31 Hard Deadlines

The following must be completed by **December 31** — no extensions, no exceptions:

- **401(k) employee contributions:** must be deducted from the final paycheck of the year. Employer contributions may be made later, but employee deferrals cannot.
- **Tax-loss harvesting:** trades must **settle** by December 31. With T+1 settlement, the last trade date is effectively **December 30**.
- **Roth conversions:** the conversion must be completed by December 31 to count for the current tax year. Unlike IRA contributions, there is no extension to April 15.
- **Charitable contributions:** cash, stock, and DAF contributions must be completed by December 31. For stock donations, initiate the transfer early — broker processing can take several business days.
- **Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs):** must be taken by December 31 (first-year RMDs have an April 1 grace period, but this causes two RMDs in one year). The penalty for missed RMDs is **25% of the shortfall** (reduced to 10% if corrected promptly under SECURE 2.0).
- **Solo 401(k) establishment:** must be established by December 31 for current-year contributions (contributions themselves can be made until the filing deadline). A **SEP-IRA** can be established and funded up to the filing deadline including extensions.
- **FSA spending:** use your remaining balance before it expires. Only the **$660 carryover** (if your plan allows it) survives into next year. Schedule those last dental cleanings and stock up on eligible medical supplies.
- **Qualified Opportunity Zone investments:** must be made within **180 days** of the gain recognition date. If your 180th day falls in December, do not miss it.
- **Medical expenses:** if itemizing and your unreimbursed medical expenses are near the **7.5% of AGI threshold**, consider accelerating planned medical expenses (elective procedures, dental work, eyeglasses) into December.
- **State/local tax payments:** for SALT deduction purposes (capped at **$40,000** under post-OBBBA law for MFJ, $20,000 for single), consider prepaying state taxes or property taxes if you have remaining cap room.

### Year-End Withholding Strategy

- If you are under-withheld, **increase W-4 withholding for your final paycheck(s)**. W-2 withholding is treated by the IRS as paid evenly throughout the year, regardless of when it was actually withheld. This is a powerful tool to avoid underpayment penalties — unlike estimated tax payments, which are attributed to specific quarterly due dates.

### Bonus Timing

- If you have discretion over bonus timing, evaluate **December vs. January receipt** based on your expected marginal bracket in each year. Confirm any deferral arrangement meets Section 409A requirements.

### Looking Ahead

- Start gathering documents for next year's filing. Create a checklist of expected forms based on this year's income sources.

---

## Year-Round Reminders

### Recordkeeping

- **Keep receipts and records** for all deductions. The IRS requires contemporaneous documentation for travel, meals (50% deductible), mileage (70 cents/mile for business in 2025), and charitable contributions.
- Charitable donations of **$250+** require written acknowledgment. Noncash over **$500** requires Form 8283; over **$5,000** generally requires a qualified appraisal.

### Investment Tracking

- Track **cost basis** for all investments, particularly **cryptocurrency** (not automatically reported by all exchanges), **RSUs** (cost basis is the FMV at vesting, which is already taxed as ordinary income — do not double-count), and **ISOs** (exercise creates AMT preference item; basis depends on whether you make a disqualifying or qualifying disposition).

### AGI Monitoring

- Monitor your **Adjusted Gross Income** throughout the year. AGI drives eligibility and phase-outs for:
  - **Roth IRA contributions** (phase-out: $150,000-$165,000 single, $236,000-$246,000 MFJ)
  - **Child Tax Credit**, education credits, and other deductions
  - **Medicare IRMAA** surcharges (based on AGI from two years prior — 2025 income affects 2027 premiums)
  - **Net Investment Income Tax** (3.8% surtax on investment income above $200K single / $250K MFJ)
  - **WA capital gains tax** threshold ($278,000 in long-term capital gains)

### Estate and Beneficiary Review

- Review **beneficiary designations** annually on retirement accounts, life insurance, and transfer-on-death accounts. Beneficiary designations override your will — outdated designations are a common and costly planning failure.

### Real Property

- **Document home improvements** with receipts, contracts, and photographs. Improvements add to your cost basis and reduce taxable gain on a future sale. Repairs do not — understand the distinction (improvement: new roof; repair: patching a leak).

### Self-Employment

- Maintain a **mileage log** (date, destination, business purpose, miles driven), **home office records** (square footage of office, total home square footage, allocated expenses), and **business expense documentation** organized by category.
- Track **estimated tax payments** and **self-employment tax** (15.3% on first $176,100 of net SE income for Social Security, 2.9% Medicare on all SE income, plus 0.9% Additional Medicare Tax on SE income above $200K single / $250K MFJ).

### Washington State Specifics

- **WA Capital Gains Tax:** track long-term capital gains toward the **$278,000 threshold** (2025). Gains above this amount are taxed at 7%. Certain exemptions apply (real estate, retirement accounts, livestock).
- **B&O Tax:** if self-employed or operating a business in Washington, monitor gross receipts for B&O tax obligations. The small business credit phases out above certain thresholds.
- **PFML and WA Cares:** save pay stubs documenting premiums paid for the Paid Family and Medical Leave program and WA Cares Fund — these may be deductible as state taxes for SALT purposes.
