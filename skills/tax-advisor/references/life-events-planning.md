## Marriage

### Filing Status Options

Filing status is determined by marital status on December 31. A couple who marries on December 31, 2025 files as married for the entire 2025 tax year.

- **Married Filing Jointly (MFJ):** Usually the better option. Combines income but provides wider brackets, higher standard deduction ($30,000 for 2025), and access to most credits without reduction.
- **Married Filing Separately (MFS):** Consider when:
  - One spouse has high student loan balances on an Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan — MFS uses only that spouse's AGI for payment calculation.
  - One spouse has significant medical expenses — the 7.5% AGI floor is lower on a single income.
  - One spouse has tax liability issues, back taxes, or audit risk — MFS isolates liability.
  - Community property states complicate MFS, but Washington is a community property state with no income tax, so this is primarily a federal consideration.

### Marriage Penalty vs. Bonus

- **Marriage penalty** occurs when both spouses earn similar high incomes. The 37% bracket starts at $751,600 for MFJ compared to $626,350 for single filers. Two single filers earning $626,350 each would not enter the 37% bracket, but filing jointly on $1,252,700 pushes a significant portion into 37%.
- **Marriage bonus** occurs when incomes are very different. A high earner married to a non-earner benefits from the wider MFJ brackets and doubled standard deduction.
- **SALT cap:** Under OBBBA, the SALT deduction cap is $40,000 for both single and MFJ filers, so there is no marriage penalty on SALT. This is an improvement over the prior $10,000 cap.

### Planning Actions at Marriage

- Update W-4 withholding immediately. The IRS Tax Withholding Estimator can help calculate the correct combined withholding. Under-withholding penalties apply if less than 90% of current year tax or 100% of prior year tax (110% if AGI exceeds $150,000) is paid in.
- Update beneficiary designations on retirement accounts, life insurance, and TOD/POD accounts.
- Review and update estate plans — wills, trusts, powers of attorney, healthcare directives.
- Consider combining or coordinating employer benefit elections (health insurance, FSAs, retirement contributions).

## Children and Dependents

### Child Tax Credit

The OBBBA increased the Child Tax Credit to **$2,200 per qualifying child under age 17**. The credit phases out at $200,000 MAGI for single filers and $400,000 for MFJ. The phase-out rate is $50 per $1,000 of excess MAGI. Refundable portion (Additional Child Tax Credit) available for lower-income filers.

### Child and Dependent Care Credit

Covers expenses for care of children under 13 (or disabled dependents) to allow the taxpayer to work. Maximum qualifying expenses: $3,000 for one child, $6,000 for two or more. Credit rate ranges from 20% to 35% based on AGI (35% for AGI up to $15,000, phasing down to 20% at $43,000+). This is a non-refundable credit.

### Dependent Care FSA

Allows up to **$5,000 pre-tax** ($2,500 if MFS) through employer cafeteria plan. Coordination rule: cannot claim the Child and Dependent Care Credit on the same expenses used for the DCFSA. If you have two or more children, you can split — use $5,000 in DCFSA and claim CDCTC on the remaining $1,000 of qualifying expenses. For most families with AGI above $43,000, the DCFSA provides greater tax savings than the 20% CDCTC.

### 529 Education Savings Plans

- Contributions are **not federally deductible**, but growth and withdrawals are tax-free for qualified education expenses.
- Annual gift tax exclusion: up to **$19,000 per beneficiary** ($38,000 from a married couple using gift-splitting) without gift tax implications.
- **Superfunding election:** A contributor may front-load up to **$95,000** ($190,000 for a couple) by making a five-year gift tax election on Form 709. No additional gifts to that beneficiary during the five-year period.
- Qualified uses now include **K-12 tuition** (up to $10,000 per year per beneficiary) and **student loan repayment** ($10,000 lifetime per beneficiary).
- Beneficiary can be changed to another family member without tax consequences.
- Excess 529 funds (up to $35,000 lifetime) can be rolled to a Roth IRA for the beneficiary under SECURE 2.0, subject to annual Roth IRA contribution limits and a 15-year account age requirement.

### Adoption Credit

Up to **$17,280** for qualified adoption expenses in 2025. Phase-out begins at $259,190 MAGI and is fully phased out at $299,190. The credit is non-refundable but can be carried forward for up to five years. Special-needs adoptions receive the full credit regardless of actual expenses.

### Head of Household Filing Status

Unmarried taxpayers (or those considered unmarried) who maintain a home for a qualifying child for more than half the year may file as Head of Household. This provides a higher standard deduction of **$23,625** and more favorable tax brackets than single filing status.

### Kiddie Tax

Unearned income (interest, dividends, capital gains) of children under age 19, or full-time students under age 24, is taxed at the **parent's marginal rate** for amounts exceeding **$2,500** (2025 threshold). The first $1,250 is tax-free, the next $1,250 is taxed at the child's rate, and amounts above $2,500 are taxed at the parent's rate. This prevents income-shifting strategies using custodial accounts.

### Family Employment

A sole proprietorship can hire their own children. Children **under age 18** employed by a parent's sole proprietorship are **exempt from FICA taxes** (Social Security and Medicare). This shifts income to the child's lower bracket — a child can earn up to the standard deduction ($15,350 for 2025) tax-free. Requirements: the work must be legitimate, the wages must be reasonable for the services performed, and proper payroll records must be maintained. This does not apply to partnerships, corporations, or S-Corps.

## Home Purchase

### Mortgage Interest Deduction

Interest on acquisition indebtedness up to **$750,000** (for loans originated after December 15, 2017) is deductible on Schedule A. Taxpayers must itemize to benefit. With the OBBBA's increased SALT cap of $40,000, more taxpayers — particularly those in high-cost areas — may now find that itemizing exceeds the standard deduction.

### Property Tax Deduction

Property taxes are deductible on Schedule A but count toward the **$40,000 SALT cap** (along with state and local income or sales taxes). In Washington, where there is no state income tax, property tax is the primary component of the SALT deduction.

### Points

Points paid on a mortgage for the **purchase of a primary residence** are fully deductible in the year paid, provided the payment of points is an established practice in the area and the amount is within the range typically charged. Points on refinancing must be amortized over the life of the loan.

### PMI and First-Time Homebuyer Credit

The mortgage insurance premium deduction has **expired and was not renewed**. There is **no current federal first-time homebuyer tax credit**.

### Home Equity Loan Interest

Interest on home equity loans or lines of credit is deductible **only** if the proceeds are used to buy, build, or substantially improve the home securing the loan. Interest on home equity debt used for other purposes (debt consolidation, education, etc.) is not deductible.

---

## Home Sale

### Section 121 Exclusion

Taxpayers may exclude up to **$250,000** of gain (single) or **$500,000** (MFJ) from the sale of a primary residence. Both spouses must meet the use test, but only one must meet the ownership test for the full $500,000 exclusion.

### Ownership and Use Tests

The taxpayer must have **owned AND used** the property as their primary residence for at least **2 of the 5 years** preceding the sale. The two years need not be consecutive. The exclusion cannot be used more than once every two years.

### Partial Exclusion

If the ownership and use tests are not fully met, a **partial exclusion** may be available if the sale is due to a change in place of employment (more than 50 miles), health reasons, or unforeseen circumstances (as defined in IRS regulations). The exclusion is pro-rated based on the fraction of the two-year requirement that was met.

### Basis Calculations

Basis equals purchase price plus capital improvements minus any depreciation claimed (including depreciation for home office or rental use). Common improvements that increase basis: additions, new roof, major renovations. Repairs and maintenance do not increase basis.

### Depreciation Recapture

If depreciation was claimed on a home office or rental portion, that depreciation is subject to **25% unrecaptured Section 1250 gain** tax, even if the overall gain is excluded under Section 121. Taxpayers who used the simplified home office method (not actual depreciation) are not subject to recapture.

### Washington State

Real estate gains are **excluded** from Washington's capital gains tax. This applies regardless of the amount of gain.

## Job Change

### 401(k) Rollover

Roll the balance to a new employer plan or an IRA. A **direct trustee-to-trustee transfer** avoids the 20% mandatory withholding that applies to distributions paid to the taxpayer. If a distribution is paid to the taxpayer, the full amount must be deposited into a qualifying account within **60 days** to avoid tax and penalties (the taxpayer must come up with the 20% withheld out of pocket and reclaim it as a refund).

### Do Not Cash Out

Cashing out a 401(k) triggers **ordinary income tax plus a 10% early withdrawal penalty** if under age 59-1/2. On a $100,000 balance for someone in the 32% bracket: $32,000 income tax + $10,000 penalty = **$42,000** lost to taxes and penalties.

### Signing Bonuses and Timing

Signing bonuses are taxed as supplemental wages with 22% federal withholding (37% for amounts over $1 million). The actual tax is at the taxpayer's marginal rate. Consider negotiating the timing — a bonus paid in January vs. December shifts it to a different tax year, which may be beneficial if income levels differ between years.

### Stock Compensation

- **ISOs/NQSOs:** Leaving an employer often triggers a **90-day exercise window** for vested stock options. Plan exercises before departure if beneficial. ISO exercises may trigger AMT liability.
- **RSU vesting acceleration:** Some plans accelerate vesting upon termination, creating a large ordinary income event in a single year. Ensure adequate withholding — supplemental wage rates may not cover the full tax at higher marginal rates.

### HSA Portability

The HSA belongs to the individual regardless of employer. It is fully portable. During a job transition, maintaining an HDHP through COBRA preserves HSA contribution eligibility but COBRA premiums are typically expensive. Evaluate whether continuing HDHP coverage is worth the HSA contribution benefit.

### Negotiation Considerations

Relocation expenses reimbursed by the employer are **taxable income** (TCJA eliminated the moving expense deduction except for active-duty military). Negotiate gross-ups if possible. Start date timing can affect which tax year receives the first paycheck and signing bonus.

## Starting a Business

### Entity Selection

- **Sole Proprietorship:** Simplest structure, reported on Schedule C. No liability protection. Subject to self-employment tax (15.3% on first $168,600, 2.9% above) on all net earnings.
- **LLC:** Provides liability protection with pass-through taxation. Taxed as a disregarded entity (sole prop) by default, or can elect S-Corp or C-Corp treatment.
- **S-Corp:** Provides SE tax savings when net income exceeds approximately $50,000. The owner pays themselves a reasonable salary (subject to FICA) and takes remaining profit as distributions (not subject to SE tax). Requires payroll administration.
- **C-Corp:** Rarely optimal for small businesses due to double taxation, but offers **Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS)** potential — Section 1202 allows exclusion of up to $10 million in gain (or 10x basis) if stock is held for 5+ years.

### Startup Costs and Deductions

The first **$5,000** of startup costs can be deducted immediately (reduced dollar-for-dollar if total startup costs exceed $50,000). The remainder is amortized over **180 months** (15 years). Organizational costs follow the same structure.

### Estimated Taxes

Quarterly estimated tax payments are required if the taxpayer expects to owe **$1,000 or more** for the year. Due dates: April 15, June 15, September 15, January 15. Penalties apply for underpayment.

### Key Deductions from Day One

- **Home office:** Deductible if the space is used regularly and exclusively for business. Simplified method: $5 per square foot, up to 300 sq ft ($1,500 max). Regular method: actual expenses allocated by square footage.
- **Vehicle:** Track mileage from first business use. Standard mileage rate or actual expenses. Cannot switch from actual to standard on the same vehicle after year one.
- **Health insurance:** Self-employed health insurance deduction (above-the-line) is available if no employer-subsidized coverage is available through a spouse.
- **Retirement plan:** Establish a **Solo 401(k) by December 31** to make employee elective deferrals for the current year (up to $23,500; $31,000 if age 50+; $34,750 if age 60-63 under SECURE 2.0 super catch-up). Employer contributions can be made until the filing deadline.

### Washington State Requirements

- Register with the Department of Revenue and begin filing **B&O tax returns** (gross receipts tax — no deductions for expenses).
- Obtain a **Washington State business license** (and city business license if applicable).
- B&O rates vary by classification (e.g., 0.471% for service, 0.484% for retailing).

## Retirement

### Social Security Optimization

- **Claiming age 62:** Permanently reduced benefit (~30% reduction from FRA).
- **Full Retirement Age (FRA):** Age 66-67 depending on birth year. Full benefit amount.
- **Delaying to age 70:** **8% per year** delayed retirement credits beyond FRA. A benefit of $2,000/month at FRA becomes $2,480/month at 70.
- **Spousal benefit:** Up to 50% of the higher earner's FRA benefit. Does not increase with delayed credits beyond FRA.
- **Break-even analysis:** Typically, delaying pays off if the retiree lives past the late 70s to early 80s.

### Social Security Taxation

Up to **85% of Social Security benefits** are includable in taxable income. Based on "combined income" (AGI + nontaxable interest + 50% of Social Security). Thresholds: $25,000-$34,000 single / $32,000-$44,000 MFJ. These thresholds are **not indexed for inflation**, causing more retirees to be subject to taxation each year.

### Medicare IRMAA Surcharges

If MAGI exceeds **$106,000 single / $212,000 MFJ** (2025), higher premiums apply to Medicare Part B and Part D. IRMAA is based on the tax return from **two years prior** (2023 return for 2025 premiums). A **life-changing event** (retirement, marriage, divorce, death of spouse) allows a request for recalculation using current-year income via Form SSA-44.

### Roth Conversion Strategy

In early retirement before RMDs and Social Security, income may be low — an ideal time to convert traditional IRA balances to Roth at low marginal rates. The **5-year rule** requires that each conversion be held for 5 years before penalty-free withdrawal of the converted amount (if under 59-1/2). After 59-1/2, the 5-year rule does not apply to conversions. Strategic conversions can reduce future RMDs and the associated tax burden.

### Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)

RMDs begin at **age 73** (age 75 starting in 2033 under SECURE 2.0). Calculated using the Uniform Lifetime Table based on account balance as of December 31 of the prior year. Failure to take RMDs results in a **25% penalty** on the amount not distributed (reduced to 10% if corrected within two years). **Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs)** of up to $105,000 directly from an IRA to charity satisfy RMD requirements and are excluded from income. Consider completing Roth conversions before RMDs begin to reduce the tax impact.

### Withdrawal Sequencing

General guidance: draw from **taxable accounts first**, then **tax-deferred** (traditional IRA/401k), then **Roth** last. However, flexible sequencing based on bracket management often produces better outcomes. Fill lower brackets with traditional withdrawals or Roth conversions each year, use Roth for amounts that would push into higher brackets.

### Washington State Advantage

Washington imposes **no state income tax on any retirement income** — pensions, Social Security benefits, 401(k) distributions, IRA withdrawals, and annuity income are all untaxed at the state level. This makes Washington an advantageous state for retirement.

---

## Divorce

### Alimony

For divorce or separation agreements executed **after December 31, 2018**, alimony is **not deductible** by the payer and **not includable in income** by the recipient. This rule was enacted by TCJA and made permanent by OBBBA. Pre-2019 agreements follow the old rules (deductible/includable) unless modified to specifically adopt the new treatment.

### Property Division

Transfers of property between spouses (or former spouses incident to divorce) are generally **tax-free** under Section 1041. The recipient takes the transferor's basis (carryover basis). This applies to real estate, investments, and other assets. Be aware that while the division is tax-free, the built-in gain or loss transfers with the asset — receiving a $500,000 asset with a $100,000 basis means $400,000 of future taxable gain.

### Retirement Account Division

- **Employer plans (401k, pension):** Divided via a **Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO)**. The receiving spouse can roll the funds to their own IRA or, uniquely, take a distribution without the 10% early withdrawal penalty (still subject to income tax).
- **IRAs:** Transferred incident to divorce via a trustee-to-trustee transfer or by changing the account name. No QDRO required. No tax or penalty on the transfer.

### Filing Status and Dependency

Filing status is determined by **marital status on December 31**. A taxpayer who is divorced by year-end files as single (or Head of Household if they maintained a household for a qualifying child for more than half the year). The **custodial parent** claims the child as a dependent unless Form 8332 is signed, releasing the exemption to the non-custodial parent. Form 8332 transfers only the dependency exemption and Child Tax Credit — it does not transfer Head of Household status, EITC, or the Child and Dependent Care Credit, which always remain with the custodial parent.

## Moving To or From Washington State

### Moving to Washington

No state income tax applies starting immediately upon establishing residency. If moving from a state with income tax, the taxpayer may still owe **part-year state income tax** to the prior state on income earned while a resident there. Roth conversions become more attractive in Washington — converting traditional IRA balances while a WA resident avoids state income tax on the conversion (whereas the same conversion in California, for example, would be taxed at up to 13.3%).

### Moving from Washington

The taxpayer will now owe state income tax in the new state. Consider **accelerating income recognition and Roth conversions before the move** while still a WA resident to take advantage of the zero state income tax rate. This includes exercising stock options, recognizing capital gains, and converting retirement accounts.

### Domicile and Residency

Washington residency is determined by **intent** — where the taxpayer considers their permanent home. Key factors include: driver's license, voter registration, vehicle registration, where the taxpayer sleeps most nights, mailing address, bank account locations, and professional and social ties. Maintain thorough documentation of domicile, especially if spending significant time in multiple states.

### Washington Capital Gains Tax Considerations

The WA capital gains tax (7% on long-term gains exceeding $270,000) is based on **residency status on December 31** of the tax year. A taxpayer who moves out of Washington before December 31 may avoid WA capital gains tax on that year's gains. Conversely, someone moving to WA before December 31 becomes subject to it. Real estate gains are excluded from the WA capital gains tax regardless of residency timing. Standard deductions, qualified retirement account distributions, and gains from the sale of certain family-owned small businesses are also excluded.
