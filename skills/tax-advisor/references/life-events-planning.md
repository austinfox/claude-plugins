# Tax Planning Around Major Life Events (2025, Post-OBBBA)

This reference covers tax implications, planning strategies, and Washington State-specific considerations for major life events under the current tax code as amended by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA).

## Marriage

### Filing Status Options: MFJ vs. MFS Analysis

After marriage, couples must choose between Married Filing Jointly (MFJ) and Married Filing Separately (MFS). Filing status is determined by marital status on December 31. In the vast majority of cases, MFJ produces a lower total tax liability, but there are specific scenarios where MFS may be preferable.

### Marriage Bonus

A marriage bonus occurs when two spouses with significantly unequal incomes combine onto a joint return. The MFJ tax brackets are wider than single brackets (roughly double through the 32% bracket under TCJA/OBBBA), so the lower-earning spouse's income is taxed at lower marginal rates than it would be on a separate return. The larger the income disparity, the greater the bonus. For example, if one spouse earns $250,000 and the other earns $40,000, the combined MFJ tax is meaningfully lower than the sum of two single-filer returns because a larger portion of income stays in lower brackets.

### Marriage Penalty

A marriage penalty arises when two similar high earners combine incomes, pushing their joint income into higher brackets faster than if each filed individually. The 35% and 37% MFJ brackets are not exactly double their single-filer counterparts, creating a penalty zone for dual high-income households. Under the permanent TCJA/OBBBA bracket structure, this penalty is less severe than under pre-2017 law because most MFJ brackets through the 32% level are exactly double the single brackets. The 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) threshold is $250,000 MFJ vs. $200,000 single, which also creates a penalty zone.

### MFS Disadvantages

Filing MFS causes the loss or severe reduction of numerous tax benefits:
- **EITC**: completely disallowed
- **Education credits** (AOTC, LLC): completely disallowed
- **Child Tax Credit**: partially reduced (lower phase-out threshold)
- **Student loan interest deduction**: disallowed
- **IRA deduction phase-outs**: significantly lower ranges
- **Roth IRA contributions**: completely prohibited if you lived with your spouse at any time during the year (MAGI phase-out starts at $0)
- **Standard deduction**: half of MFJ ($15,750 each vs. $31,500 MFJ)

MFS may still make sense in narrow situations: protecting one spouse from the other's tax liabilities, income-driven student loan repayment optimization, or when one spouse has large medical expenses (the 7.5% AGI floor is lower on lower separate AGI).

### Community Property Considerations (WA-Specific)

Washington is a community property state. All income earned during the marriage is community property, split 50/50 between spouses regardless of who earned it. If filing MFS, each spouse must report half of all community income on their separate return. This eliminates many of the bracket-arbitrage benefits of MFS and makes the filing more complex. Separate property (owned before marriage or received as gift/inheritance) retains its character and is reported by the owning spouse.

### Withholding Adjustment

Both spouses should update their W-4s promptly after marriage. The "Two Earners/Multiple Jobs" section of the W-4 is critical to avoid under-withholding. Use the IRS Tax Withholding Estimator (irs.gov) to calculate proper withholding, especially if incomes are unequal or one spouse has significant non-wage income. Under-withholding penalties apply if less than 90% of current year tax or 100% of prior year tax (110% if AGI exceeds $150,000) is paid in.

### Combined SALT Benefit

The OBBBA increased the SALT deduction cap to $40,000 for MFJ filers. Two property owners who previously each had separate SALT deductions may now find the combined $40,000 cap more beneficial when filing jointly. Evaluate combined property taxes and sales taxes (WA has no state income tax, so property tax and sales tax are the primary SALT components) and determine whether itemizing exceeds the $31,500 MFJ standard deduction.

### Combined Charitable Giving Strategy

With the MFJ standard deduction at $31,500, married couples need substantial deductions to benefit from itemizing. A Donor-Advised Fund (DAF) bunching strategy becomes more effective at the higher MFJ threshold: combine two or three years of charitable contributions into a single year to exceed the standard deduction in that year, then take the standard deduction in alternate years. This is especially powerful when combined with SALT deductions near the $40,000 cap.

## Children / Dependents

### Child Tax Credit

The OBBBA increased the Child Tax Credit to **$2,200 per qualifying child under age 17**. The credit phases out at $200,000 MAGI (single) / $400,000 (MFJ), reducing by $50 per $1,000 of excess MAGI. The refundable portion (Additional Child Tax Credit) is available for lower-income filers.

### Child and Dependent Care Credit

Covers expenses for care of a child under 13 (or disabled dependent) while the taxpayer works. Maximum qualifying expenses: **$3,000 for one child / $6,000 for two or more**. Credit rate ranges from 20% to 35% of qualifying expenses depending on AGI (35% for AGI under $15,000, phasing down to 20% at AGI above $43,000). The credit is nonrefundable.

### Dependent Care FSA

Employers may offer a Dependent Care FSA allowing up to **$5,000/year** ($2,500 MFS) in pre-tax contributions for dependent care expenses. Coordination rule: you cannot double-dip the same expenses. If you have two or more children, you can use $5,000 through the FSA and claim the CDCTC on the remaining $1,000 of the $6,000 maximum qualifying expenses.

### EITC Expansion with Children

The Earned Income Tax Credit for 2025 provides up to **$7,830 with three or more qualifying children**. Approximate maximums: $4,328 (one child), $7,152 (two children), $7,830 (three or more). Income limits vary by filing status. The EITC is fully refundable and remains one of the most valuable credits for moderate-income families.

### Head of Household Filing Status

Single parents with a qualifying dependent may file as Head of Household, which provides wider tax brackets and a higher standard deduction than the Single filing status. This results in meaningfully lower tax compared to filing as Single. Must maintain a home that is the principal residence for the qualifying child for more than half the year.

### 529 Plans

Contributions to 529 education savings plans grow tax-free, and distributions are tax-free for qualified education expenses (tuition, room and board, books, K-12 tuition up to $10,000/year, student loan repayment up to $10,000 lifetime per beneficiary). **WA-specific**: Washington has no state income tax, so there is no state deduction for 529 contributions (unlike states such as New York or Virginia that offer state tax deductions). WA residents can contribute to any state's 529 plan without losing a state tax benefit they never had.

**Superfunding**: The annual gift tax exclusion for 2025 is **$19,000 per recipient**. Under the 5-year gift tax averaging election (IRC Section 529(c)(2)(B)), a contributor can front-load up to **$95,000 per beneficiary** ($19,000 x 5 years) in a single year without triggering gift tax. A married couple can superfund up to **$190,000 per beneficiary**. No additional gifts can be made to that beneficiary during the 5-year period. File Form 709 to make the election.

### Custodial Accounts (UGMA/UTMA) and Kiddie Tax

For 2025, the kiddie tax applies to a child's unearned income exceeding **$2,700**. The first $1,350 is tax-free, the next $1,350 is taxed at the child's rate, and amounts above $2,700 are taxed at the parent's marginal rate. The kiddie tax applies to children under 19 (or under 24 if a full-time student). This significantly limits the benefit of shifting investment income to children through custodial accounts.

### Adoption Credit

For 2025, the adoption tax credit is up to approximately **$17,280** for qualified adoption expenses per eligible child. The credit is nonrefundable but can be carried forward for up to five years. Phase-out begins at MAGI around $259,190 and is fully phased out around $299,190. The credit applies to both domestic and international adoptions, with special rules for special-needs adoptions (full credit regardless of actual expenses).

---

## Home Purchase

### Mortgage Interest Deduction

Interest on mortgage debt is deductible for acquisition indebtedness up to **$750,000** (for mortgages originated after December 15, 2017). For MFS filers, the limit is $375,000. To benefit, total itemized deductions must exceed the standard deduction ($15,700 single / $31,500 MFJ). The deduction applies to primary residences and one second home.

### Points

Points (prepaid interest) paid at closing on a home purchase loan are generally fully deductible in the year of purchase if they meet IRS requirements (established practice in the area, not excessive, computed as a percentage of the principal, paid directly by the borrower at or before closing). Points on a refinance must be amortized over the life of the loan.

### Property Tax (SALT)

Property taxes are deductible as part of the SALT deduction, subject to the **$40,000 cap** (MFJ) under OBBBA ($20,000 MFS). In Washington, where there is no state income tax, property taxes are the primary SALT component. Combined with sales tax deductions, many WA homeowners in high-cost areas can approach this cap.

### PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance)

The deduction for private mortgage insurance premiums is **not available for 2025**. The provision has expired and was not extended by OBBBA or other recent legislation.

### NEW: Auto Loan Interest Deduction (OBBBA)

The OBBBA introduced a new above-the-line deduction for auto loan interest on **US-assembled vehicles**, up to **$10,000 per year**. MAGI phase-out: begins at $100,000 (single) / $200,000 (MFJ). The vehicle must be assembled in the United States. This deduction is available regardless of whether the taxpayer itemizes.

### First-Time Homebuyer Credit

There is **no active federal first-time homebuyer tax credit** for 2025. Various programs have expired. Check state and local programs for down payment assistance or other incentives.

### Home Sale Exclusion (Section 121)

Gain from the sale of a primary residence is excluded from income up to **$250,000 (single) / $500,000 (MFJ)**, provided the taxpayer owned and used the home as a primary residence for at least 2 of the 5 years preceding the sale. The exclusion cannot be used more than once every two years. **WA-specific**: real estate gains are excluded from the WA capital gains tax regardless of amount, since the WA capital gains tax exempts real estate transactions.

### Home Equity Loan Interest

Interest on home equity loans or lines of credit (HELOCs) is deductible **only if** the loan proceeds are used to buy, build, or substantially improve the residence securing the loan. Interest on home equity debt used for other purposes (debt consolidation, car purchases, vacations) is not deductible under current law.

## Job Change

### 401(k) Rollover

When leaving an employer, roll the old 401(k) to the new employer's plan or to an IRA. A **direct rollover** (trustee-to-trustee transfer) avoids the 20% mandatory federal withholding that applies to indirect rollovers. For indirect rollovers, you have **60 days** to deposit the full amount (including replacing the withheld 20% from other funds) into the new account, or it becomes a taxable distribution plus a 10% early withdrawal penalty if under age 59 1/2.

### Backdoor Roth Implications

If you plan to use the backdoor Roth IRA strategy, avoid rolling old 401(k) funds into a traditional IRA. The **pro-rata rule** requires that all traditional IRA balances be considered when converting, which can make a significant portion of the conversion taxable. Instead, roll old 401(k) funds into the new employer's 401(k) plan to keep your traditional IRA balance at $0 for a clean backdoor Roth conversion.

### Signing Bonus Timing

Large signing bonuses can push income into a higher bracket. If possible, negotiate to split the bonus across two calendar years to reduce the marginal rate impact. Be aware that signing bonuses are subject to supplemental withholding rates (22% federal, or 37% for amounts over $1 million in a year), which may not match the actual tax liability.

### Stock Option Exercise Planning

ISOs and NQSOs typically must be exercised within **90 days** of departure (check plan documents for exact terms). ISOs exercised may trigger **AMT** liability if the bargain element (FMV minus exercise price) is large. NQSOs are taxed as ordinary income on the bargain element at exercise. Plan the timing carefully around year-end to manage bracket impact and consider spreading exercises across tax years if the 90-day window allows.

### RSU Acceleration

Some companies accelerate unvested RSU vesting upon departure (especially in acquisition scenarios or senior-level agreements). Accelerated vesting creates a large one-time ordinary income event. Ensure withholding is adequate -- supplemental withholding rates may not cover the actual tax liability at high income levels. Consider increasing 401(k) deferrals if still employed to offset the income spike.

### COBRA and ACA Marketplace

COBRA continuation coverage can be expensive (full premium plus 2% administrative fee). If purchasing coverage through the ACA Marketplace during an employment gap, premium tax credits may be available depending on projected annual income. Be careful not to earn too much during the year, as excess premium tax credits must be repaid at filing.

### HSA Considerations

If leaving an employer that offers a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP), existing HSA balances remain yours and can be used for qualified medical expenses indefinitely. However, if the new employer does not offer an HDHP (or during a gap in HDHP coverage), **you cannot contribute new funds** to the HSA during non-HDHP months. Prorate the annual contribution limit accordingly.

### Relocation, Severance, and Unemployment

- **Relocation**: employer-paid relocation is **taxable income** since TCJA (2018). The employee deduction for moving expenses was eliminated (except active-duty military). Still valuable to negotiate -- it is real money even after taxes. Ask for a tax gross-up if possible.
- **Severance**: taxed as ordinary income and subject to FICA. Large severance payments may push income into a higher bracket. Consider maximizing 401(k) contributions or timing the severance around year-end to manage bracket impact.
- **Unemployment**: fully taxable as ordinary income at the federal level. **WA-specific**: Washington has no state income tax, so unemployment benefits are not subject to state income tax.

## Starting a Business

### Entity Selection

The choice of entity structure has significant tax implications. Reference `self-employment-business.md` for the detailed decision tree: **sole proprietorship** (simplest, Schedule C, full SE tax) to **single-member LLC** (liability protection, same tax treatment as sole prop by default) to **S-Corp election** (potential SE tax savings when paying reasonable salary) to **C-Corp** (21% flat rate, but double taxation on distributions). OBBBA made the TCJA Section 199A QBI deduction permanent for pass-through entities.

### Getting Started

- **EIN**: apply online at irs.gov, free, issued instantly. Required for hiring employees, opening business bank accounts, and most entity types.
- **Estimated tax payments**: required starting the first quarter of profitability. Due quarterly: April 15, June 15, September 15, January 15. Penalty for underpayment if you owe more than $1,000 at filing and have not met the safe harbor (90% of current year tax or 100%/110% of prior year tax).
- **Startup costs**: up to **$5,000** deductible in year one under IRC Section 195, reduced dollar-for-dollar when total startup costs exceed $50,000. Remaining costs are amortized over **180 months** (15 years).
- **Home office**: deductible from day one if the space is used **regularly and exclusively** for business. Simplified method: $5/sq ft, up to 300 sq ft ($1,500 max). Actual expense method: prorate mortgage interest, property taxes, utilities, insurance, repairs, and depreciation by business-use percentage.
- **Vehicle**: keep a contemporaneous mileage log starting from day one. Standard mileage rate or actual expense method. Cannot switch from actual to standard on the same vehicle after the first year.
- **Health insurance**: self-employed individuals can take an **above-the-line deduction** for health insurance premiums paid for themselves, spouse, and dependents, provided they are not eligible for an employer-subsidized plan (including through a spouse's employer).
- **Retirement plans**: a **Solo 401(k)** must be established by December 31 to make employee deferrals for that tax year ($23,500 for 2025, plus $7,500 catch-up if 50+). Employer contributions can be made until the tax filing deadline. SEP-IRA is simpler to administer but only allows employer-style contributions (up to 25% of net self-employment income).

### WA-Specific Business Requirements

- **WA B&O Tax**: Washington imposes a Business & Occupation tax on gross receipts (not net income). Rates vary by classification (e.g., 1.5% for service businesses, 0.471% for manufacturing). Register with the WA Department of Revenue and begin filing B&O returns. The **small business B&O tax credit** covers tax liability on approximately the first **$125,000 of gross income**, effectively exempting very small businesses.
- **WA Business License**: required for most businesses operating in Washington. Apply through the WA Business Licensing Service. Many cities (Seattle, Bellevue, Tacoma, etc.) also require separate **city business licenses** and may impose city B&O taxes.

## Retirement

### Social Security Optimization

Benefits are calculated based on the **top 35 earning years** (indexed for inflation). Claiming at age 62 permanently reduces the monthly benefit by approximately **30%** compared to full retirement age (FRA, currently age 67 for those born in 1960 or later). Delaying past FRA to age 70 increases the benefit by approximately **24% over FRA** (8% per year of delayed retirement credits). For married couples, coordinate claiming strategies: the higher earner generally benefits most from delaying to 70 to maximize both their own benefit and the eventual survivor benefit for the lower-earning spouse.

### Medicare IRMAA

Modified AGI above **$106,000 (single) / $212,000 (MFJ)** triggers Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount surcharges on Medicare Part B and Part D premiums. IRMAA uses a **2-year lookback** (2025 premiums are based on 2023 MAGI). Roth conversions, capital gains, and other income spikes can trigger surcharges in subsequent years. Strategy: plan large Roth conversions **before reaching Medicare enrollment age** (typically ages 63-64, so that IRMAA based on income at those ages affects premiums at 65-66). A life-changing event (retirement, marriage, divorce, death of spouse) allows a request for recalculation via Form SSA-44.

### Roth Conversion Ladder

Convert traditional IRA/401(k) balances to Roth annually, targeting amounts that **fill up lower tax brackets** without pushing into unnecessarily high marginal rates. **WA advantage**: zero state income tax on conversions, making Washington one of the best states for aggressive Roth conversion strategies. The **5-year rule**: each conversion must age 5 years before the converted amount can be withdrawn penalty-free if under age 59 1/2. After age 59 1/2, the 5-year rule on conversions does not apply.

### RMD Planning

Required Minimum Distributions begin at age **73** (under SECURE 2.0; age 75 starting in 2033). The penalty for failing to take an RMD is **25%** of the shortfall, reduced to **10%** if corrected within 2 years (also under SECURE 2.0). Consider Roth conversions before RMD age to reduce the traditional IRA/401(k) balance and lower future mandatory taxable distributions. Each dollar converted before RMD age is a dollar that will not generate forced taxable income later.

### Withdrawal Sequencing

The general guideline is to withdraw from **taxable accounts first** (brokerage), then **tax-deferred** (traditional IRA/401(k)), then **Roth accounts last**. However, this is not always optimal. Sometimes drawing from tax-deferred accounts earlier (in low-income years between retirement and RMD age) reduces the total lifetime tax burden by keeping future RMDs smaller and avoiding IRMAA triggers. Model multiple scenarios to optimize based on bracket management.

### Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD)

Available at age **70 1/2 or older**. Donate up to **$105,000** per year directly from a traditional IRA to a qualifying charity. The distribution counts toward the RMD requirement but is **excluded from taxable income**. This is more tax-efficient than taking the RMD as income and then donating separately, because the QCD avoids AGI increases that could trigger IRMAA surcharges, increase Social Security taxation, reduce other deduction phase-outs, or trigger the 3.8% NIIT.

## Moving to/from Washington State

### Moving TO Washington from an Income-Tax State

Time income recognition carefully to maximize the benefit of WA's lack of state income tax. Defer bonuses, stock option exercises, and Roth conversions until after establishing WA residency. Capital gains realized after becoming a WA resident avoid state income tax from the prior state but may be subject to the **WA capital gains tax** if exceeding **$278,000** from sales of financial assets (stocks, bonds -- not real estate).

### Moving FROM Washington to an Income-Tax State

Accelerate income recognition into WA years before establishing residency in the new state. Perform Roth conversions, sell appreciated assets, and exercise stock options while still a WA resident. Once you establish residency in an income-tax state, all future income will be subject to that state's tax. Every dollar of conversion or gain recognized in WA is a dollar that avoids state income tax.

### Part-Year Residency Rules

Most income-tax states tax income earned while a resident of that state. Establish a clear residency change date with thorough documentation: **driver's license**, **voter registration**, **lease or home purchase**, change of address with USPS, updated bank and financial account addresses, and updated employer records. Some states (notably California and New York) aggressively audit residency changes and may attempt to tax income earned after a claimed move if documentation is insufficient.

### WA Cares Fund

Washington's long-term care insurance program imposes a payroll premium on W-2 workers. If leaving Washington, workers may qualify for a **new exemption effective January 1, 2026** for out-of-state workers. Track legislative updates as this provision is relatively new and implementation details may evolve.

### WA Community Property and Basis Step-Up

Assets acquired during Washington residence are community property. At the death of one spouse, **both halves** of community property receive a full stepped-up basis to fair market value -- unlike common-law states where only the decedent's half receives a step-up. This is a significant estate planning advantage for married couples with highly appreciated assets acquired during WA residency. If moving to a common-law state, community property character generally follows the asset, but consult with an estate planning attorney to ensure proper documentation and preservation of this benefit.
